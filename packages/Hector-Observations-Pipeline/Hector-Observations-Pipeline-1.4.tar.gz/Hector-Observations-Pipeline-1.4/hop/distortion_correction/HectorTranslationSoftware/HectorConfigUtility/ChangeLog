Sat Dec 19 18:33:53 2020 <ks@Keiths-MacBook-Pro.local>  HectorConfigUtility version: 1.4
Fri Nov 27 16:06:57 2020 <ks@Keiths-MacBook-Pro.local>  HectorConfigUtility version: 1.3

   Removed all the extra code modules like TcsUtil and ArrayManager to a separate
   Misc packages directory.

   Added initial version of ProfitSkyCheck code. Note that HectorSkyCheck, which
   used ConeOfDarkness code, is no longer going to be used.

   Added a Makefile that will build this and all the various sub-packages from
   source. This is needed as this needs to be run on a USyd machine that does not
   have all the usual AAO software installed.
   
Fri Nov 20 13:31:27 2020 <ks@Keiths-MacBook-Pro.local>  HectorConfigUtility version: 1.2

   This is the version of the code supplied to Sam Vaughan at Sydney Uni on 13th Nov 2020.
   This now handles the input file formats as agreed between myself (KS), Julia and Sam,
   with two separate input files: for galaxies and guide stars. The output format was
   originally that described in ASD143, and a test version was sent to Sam that produced
   that format. It then became clear that what was really required was an output format
   that maintained all the fields supplied in the input files rather than a pre-determined
   field list (not all of whose values were known). The code handles the differences
   between the fields in the galaxy and guide input files, assuming only a) that the galaxy
   fields are a superset that includes all the fields supplied for the guide stars, b) that
   there is one field called RA and another called Dec - case insensitive.

   The code also includes the latest version of the telecentricity correction, but as yet
   does not handle thermal expansion. Nor does it handle the various checks needed for
   the guide stars (it does still contain the cone of darkness code, but it's now looking
   as if this will be replaced by the use of ProFit data; this can be implemented properly
   once sample files are made available).

   There still isn't a proper build mechanism, other than a set of build commands in
   build.csh, but these have been tested on both my OSX High Sierra laptop and an OS X
   Cataline Mac Mini (the latter having no installed DRAMA or similar software), and
   it seems the executables built on either machine work as a temporary measure for
   Sam to test with. (I supplied Sam with the source files in the ACMM module and
   pre-built versions of the various libraries, eg tdFUtil, which it needs. These are
   enough to build the program on most recent Macs, but not yet on other systems, like
   Linux.)

Sat Jul 20 11:05:23 2019 <ks@aaopc50vchu.aao.gov.au>  HectorConfigUtility version: 1.1

   This is the first release - a very initial release - of the Hector Configuration
   Utility program. This is intended to work with the Hector configuration program
   being developed by Caroline Foster for U Syd and performs coordinate conversion
   for the tiled target lists. It outputs a list of the targets with the XY field
   place positions calculated, together with a list of the sky fibres, which have
   been checked for contamination against a catalogue of objects and tagged for
   capping accordingly.

   As some of the details of file formats and processes are still unclear, this
   version is missing some of the required functionality. For full details, see the
   programming notes at the end of HectorConfigUtil.cpp. Essentially this code
   guesses at the field centre position, and the observing time, does nothing with
   sky fibres and omits the telecentricity correction.

   However, it will read a target list in the example format supplied by Julia
   Bryant at U Syd, and will output a file in the SAMI format suggested by Tony
   Farrell at AAO, having performed the coordinate conversions from Ra,Dec to X,Y.
   It also has all the structure required to add the missing functionality once the
   necessary details - particularly the format of the sky fibre file, the way
   observation details are associated with the target list, the telecentricity
   correction and the sky shuffling process - are available.

   To date, this has only been built on my laptop, and there isn't yet a proper
   Makefile. Instead, I have been building it using the included build.csh file,
   which will need some changes to pick up the neccessary libraries on any
   different machine. Details of how to run the program can be found in the headeer
   comments for HectorConfigUtil.cpp.

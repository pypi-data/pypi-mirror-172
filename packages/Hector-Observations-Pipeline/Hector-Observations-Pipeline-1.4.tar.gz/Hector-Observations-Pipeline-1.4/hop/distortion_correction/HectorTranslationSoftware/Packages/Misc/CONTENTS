These files are a few bits of utility code taken from various other (mainly AAO)
sub-systems that provide facilities useful for the Hector translation software.

gen_qfmed.c is a Quicksort-based routine that calculates the median of an
            array of floating point numbers. It originated with Figaro, many
            years ago and is a C version of a VAX assembler routine based on
            a Pascal routine - the original Pascal is there in the comments
            at the end of the code!

ArrayManager.cpp/.h originated with AAOGlimpse, and implements an ArrayManager
            class that allows a C++ program to treat a multi-dimensional
            array using an Array[Ix][Iy] style to refer to individual elements.
            It's very simple and very fast.

TcsUtil.cpp/.h is a set of utility routines originating with the AAT TCS
            that do things like formatting Ra,Dec values into strings nicely.
            (They do other things too, but that's what they're used for here.)

tdfxy.c/.h and associated _err files are from the AAO 2dFutil package, and
            do the conversion between 2dF field plate coordinates and sky
            Ra,Dec coordinates. The full 2dFutil package is quite large, but
            this is the only code from it needed by the Hector translation
            software.

CommandHandler.cpp/.h is an experimental command line parser being developed
            for more general-purpose use, but which is being tested initially
            with the Hector translation software. It is hoped it will simplify
            working with the large number of command line parameters,
            particularly for testing, when the command line is usually entered
            by hand.

DebugHandler.h is an small experimental C++ class that provides some control
            over the levels of debugging enabled in a program.
            
Wildcard.cpp/.h is a wildcard string-matching routine originally developed
            for the AAO Ghost project, and used here by the DebugHandler code.

# odoo-pre-commit-hooks

OCA's custom pre-commit hooks for Odoo modules


# Installation

You don't need to install it directly only configure your ".pre-commit-config.yaml" file

Even you can install using github directly

    pip install -U git+https://github.com/OCA/odoo-pre-commit-hooks.git@main


# Usage pre-commit-config.yaml

Add to your ".pre-commit-config.yaml" configuration file the following input


```yaml

    - repo: https://github.com/OCA/odoo-pre-commit-hooks
        rev: main  # Change to last version or git sha
        hooks:
        - id: oca-checks-odoo-module-local

```

# Usage using directly the entry points

If you install directly the package from github you can use the entry points:

    * HOOK-APP (TODO ADD ALL HOOKS HERE)

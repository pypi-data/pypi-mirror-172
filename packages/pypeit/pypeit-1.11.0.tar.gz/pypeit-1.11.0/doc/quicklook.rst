Quick-Look Reductions
*********************

Overview
========

PypeIt provides a set of quick-look scripts for
quick reductions, presumably at the telescope.
We describe each in turn.

----

.. _pypeit-ql-mos:

pypeit_ql_mos
=============

This script performs a boxcar (only) extraction of a long-
or multi-slit observation taken with one of PypeIt's
spectrographs.

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_ql_mos.rst

And here is a sample call on files from the Development suite:

.. code-block:: bash

    pypeit_ql_mos shane_kast_blue /home/xavier/local/Python/PypeIt-development-suite/RAW_DATA/Shane_Kast_blue/600_4310_d55 b1.fits.gz b10.fits.gz b27.fits.gz

This generates a ``shane_kast_blue_A`` folder with the standard
calibration (Masters), QA, and Science :doc:`outputs`.

This script has been tested successfully on the following instruments:
``shane_kast_blue``, ``shane_kast_red``, ``keck_lris_blue``, ``keck_deimos``.

.. _pypeit-ql-mos-options:

QL Options
++++++++++

Here are a few of the standard options:

--box_radius
------------

Specify the size of the extraction radius.

--ignore_headers
----------------

If your telescope (e.g. Keck) has a tendency to write
bad headers, you may wish to set it.  We recommend
not doing so until you see it crash from a bad header.

--det
-----

Specify the detector to be reduced. Only 1 is done at a time.

--slit_spat
-----------

Specify the spatial position of the single slit to reduce
on the detector you chose.

Examples
++++++++

shane_kast_blue::

    pypeit_ql_mos shane_kast_blue /home/xavier/local/Python/PypeIt-development-suite/RAW_DATA/Shane_Kast_blue/600_4310_d55 b1.fits.gz b10.fits.gz b27.fits.gz

keck_lris_red (longslit)::

    pypeit_ql_mos keck_lris_red /home/xavier/local/Python/PypeIt-development-suite/RAW_DATA/Keck_LRIS_red/long_600_7500_d560 LR.20160216.05709.fits.gz LR.20160216.13991.fits.gz LR.20160216.40478.fits.gz --det 2 --ignore_headers

keck_lris_blue (longslit + archived pixel flat)::

    pypeit_ql_mos keck_lris_blue /home/xavier/scratch/FRB190714/Raw b191228_1020.fits b191228_1066.fits b191228_1051.fits --det 2 --user_pixflat=/home/xavier/local/Python/PypeIt-development-suite//CALIBS/PYPEIT_LRISb_pixflat_B600_2x2_17sep2009.fits.gz

keck_deimos (multislit with one slit isolated)::

    pypeit_ql_mos keck_deimos /home/xavier/scratch/QL/2020-03-29-DEIMOS-TestData DE.20100913.56927.fits DE.20100913.57161.fits DE.20100913.22358.fits -d 7 --slit_spat 1132

It is possible all of the MOS :doc:`spectrographs/spectrographs` will work.
Give it a shot!

.. _pypeit-ql-keck-nires:

pypeit_ql_keck_nires
====================

This script performs a quick A-B reduction of a pair of
Keck/NIRES spectral images.  Currently, the code takes
2min and 20s to process two images with boxcar extractions.
Therefore, there is a first set of :ref:`nires-output` in
approximately 1 minute.

NIRES QL Setup
++++++++++++++

Before running this script, you will need to download the quick-look masters.
See the :ref:`data_installation` section of the :ref:`installing` instructions.

.. _nires-options:

NIRES QL Options
++++++++++++++++

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_ql_keck_nires.rst

NIRES QL Example
++++++++++++++++

Here is an example call::

    pypeit_ql_keck_nires /data/Keck_NIRES/Raw s180604_0089.fits.gz s180604_0090.fits.gz -b 0.5

.. _nires-output:

NIRES QL Output
+++++++++++++++

If all goes smoothly, the code will generate four spectral
output files, 2 of each spec1d and
spec2d outputs.  These can be viewed with :ref:`pypeit_show_1dspec`
and :ref:`pypeit_show_2dspec`.


.. _pypeit-ql-deimos:

pypeit_ql_keck_deimos
=====================

This scripts enables quicklook reductions on :doc:`spectrographs/deimos` data.

For the user at WMKO, the general procedure is two steps:

    #. run the script on your afternoon calibrations;

    #. run the script during the night on a given slit on a given detector.

Afternoon Calibrations
++++++++++++++++++++++

To enable fast reductions during the night, 
you will need to have processed the calibrations for
at least the detectors that you will want to inspect during the night.  
The calibration processing is expensive (~1 hour per detector per setup) 
and future work should enable
this to launch as a multi-process job.

Here is an example call that will reduce the 3rd detector for all of
the masks in the specified path::
    
    pypeit_ql_keck_deimos full_path_to_raw_files --root=DE. -d=3 --redux_path=path_for_calibs --calibs_only

This will process all the raw files in ``full_path_to_raw_files`` and put the calibration
outputs in ``path_for_calibs``.  And only for ``detector=3``.

If you are running at WMKO and have access to a sizeable machine with
50+Gb RAM and 8 processors, you can launch one command like the one above for
each detector.

One Slit
++++++++

To reduce a single slit on a single detector for a single exposure, you would issue
a command like::

    pypeit_ql_keck_deimos full_path_to_raw_files --science=DE.20130409.20629.fits --slit_spat=3:763 --redux_path=path_to_calibs 

This will process and extract spectra from the ``slit_id=763`` in the 
science exposure ``DE.20130409.20629.fits``.  Again, you specify
the path to the RAW frames and the ``path_for_calibs``, which is also
where the reduced spectra will appear.  

We estimate 2min for full extraction on a single slit.

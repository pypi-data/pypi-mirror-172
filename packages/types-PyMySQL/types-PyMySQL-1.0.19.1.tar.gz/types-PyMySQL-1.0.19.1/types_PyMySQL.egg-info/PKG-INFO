## Typing stubs for PyMySQL

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `PyMySQL` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `PyMySQL`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/PyMySQL. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `3e828bd307ad13cfa36573f861ad88373bef7963`.

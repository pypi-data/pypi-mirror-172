  """Custom derivative rule for lse that does not blow up with -inf.

  This logsumexp implementation uses the standard jax one in forward mode but
  implements a custom rule to differentiate. Given the preference of jax for
  jvp over vjp, and the fact that this is a simple linear rule, jvp is used.
  This custom differentiation address issues when the output of lse is
  -inf (which corresponds to the case where all inputs in a slice are -inf,
  which happens typically when ``a`` or ``b`` weight vectors have zeros.)

  Although both exp(lse) and its derivative should be 0, automatic
  differentiation returns a NaN derivative because of a -inf - (-inf) operation
  appearing in the definition of centered_exp below. This is corrected in the
  implementation below.

  Args:
    axis: argument from original logsumexp
    keepdims: argument from original logsumexp
    return_sign: argument from original logsumexp
    primals: mat and b, the two arguments against which we differentiate.
    tangents: of same size as mat and b.

  Returns:
    original primal outputs + their tangent.

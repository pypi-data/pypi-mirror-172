A package of utilities for parsing, analyzing, and displaying data in `har` files.
Particularly in relation to helping develop [locust](https://locust.io/) performance test scripts.

***HarF* is heavily biased towards REST(ish) json based apis**

Currently the project only provides a CLI and library to help track data through a har file.
The CLI (`correlations`) displays what data is used where in a har file, some basic filters, and two ways to interact with the data. 
For more information use `correlations --help` to see everything supported by the CLI.

### Basic Output
For small `har` files this basic output is probably sufficient.
For example, if you use the `tests/example1.har` file with modified filters you will see all the values used in a request. `correlations tests/example1.har -x 100`
```
Value ('products') used in:  
   "entry_0.request.url[0]"  
  
Value (1) used in:  
   "entry_0.response.body[0].id",  
   "entry_1.request.url[1]",  
   "entry_1.response.body[0].id",  
   "entry_2.request.body.productId"  
  
Value ('test') used in:  
   "entry_0.response.body[0].name",  
   "entry_1.response.body[0].name"  
  
Value ('product') used in:  
   "entry_1.request.url[0]"  
  
Value (1.1) used in:  
   "entry_1.response.body[0].price"  
  
Value ('cart') used in:  
   "entry_2.request.url[0]"
```

### Interactive Output
Once you start getting into larger files with hundreds of requests and dozens of values that need to be tracked the basic output is not all that helpful.
HarF provides two ways to interact with the data dynamically.

With `-i` you will be dropped into a python shell with the har data, correlation info, and some utility functions to inspect and manipulate the data as needed.

And because I am an [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) nerd `-o <vault_path>` will output a bunch of markdown files to the `vault_path` where every request, response, and used value gets their own note and are back-linked through usage.

Colors are made from the `pageref` info where entries on page earlier in the trace are closer to the red end of the rainbow and later requests are closer to the purple/pink end.
Additionally if there are **Comment Requests** (requests that begin with `http://COMMENT`) every entry is "re-paged" based on the Comment Request before it and the Comment Requests are removed.
E.G. `GET http://COMMENT/homepage; GET http://www.example.com pageref:page_1;` becomes `GET http://www.example.com pageref:homepage;`

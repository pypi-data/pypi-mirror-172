# michie

Distributed high-throughput pythonic framework for multi-agent simulations

## Installation

`michie` is available on PyPI. To install it

```
pip install michie
```

## Usage

In `michie` each object has its own **state** and there is one **global state**

There are **three** distinct types of operations in `michie`:

- **GlobalStateMappers**
    -  Can **read** and **write** **every state**
    -  Can **read** and **wite** the **global state**
    -  Are executed **synchronously** from the *Master process*
- **StateMappers**
    - Can **read** and **write** **one state**
    - Can **only read** the **global state**
    - Are executed **asynchronously** from the *Worker processes*
- **Transitions**
    - Can **read** and **write** **one state**
    - **Cannot read** the **global state**
    - Are executed **asynchronously** from the *Worker processes*

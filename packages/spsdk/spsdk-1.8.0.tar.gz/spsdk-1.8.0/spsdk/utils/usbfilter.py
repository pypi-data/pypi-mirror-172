class USBDeviceFilter:
    """Generic USB Device Filtering class.

    Create a filtering instance. This instance holds the USB ID you are interested
    in during USB HID device search and allows you to compare, whether
    provided USB HID object is the one you are interested in.
    The allowed format of `usb_id` string is following:

    vid or pid - vendor ID or product ID. String holding hex or dec number.
    Hex number must be preceded by 0x or 0X. Number of characters after 0x is
    1 - 4. Mixed upper & lower case letters is allowed. e.g. "0xaB12", "0XAB12",
    "0x1", "0x0001".
    The decimal number is restricted only to have 1 - 5 digits, e.g. "65535"
    It's allowed to set the USB filter ID to decimal number "99999", however, as
    the USB VID number is four-byte hex number (max value is 65535), this will
    lead to zero results. Leading zeros are not allowed e.g. 0001. This will
    result as invalid match.

    The user may provide a single number as usb_id. In such a case the number
    may represent either VID or PID. By default, the filter expects this number
    to be a VID. In rare cases the user may want to filter based on PID.
    Initialize the `search_by_pid` parameter to True in such cases.

    vid/pid - string of vendor ID & product ID separated by ':' or ','
    Same rules apply to the number format as in VID case, except, that the
    string consists of two numbers separated by ':' or ','. It's not allowed
    to mix hex and dec numbers, e.g. "0xab12:12345" is not allowed.
    Valid vid/pid strings:
    "0x12aB:0xabc", "1,99999"

    Windows specific:
    instance ID - String in following format "HID\\VID_<HEX>&PID_<HEX>\\<instance_id>",
    see instance ID in device manager under Windows OS.

    Linux specific:
    USB device path - HID API returns path in following form:
    '0003:0002:00'

    The first number represents the Bus, the second Device and the third interface. The Bus:Device
    number is unique so interface is not necessary and Bus:Device should be sufficient.

    The Bus:Device can be observed using 'lsusb' command. The interface can be observed using
    'lsusb -t'. lsusb returns the Bus and Device as a 3-digit number.
    It has been agreed, that the expected input is:
    <Bus in dec>#<Device in dec>, e.g. 3#11

    Mac specific:
    USB device path - HID API returns path in roughly following form:
    'IOService:/AppleACPIPlatformExpert/PCI0@0/AppleACPIPCI/XHC1@14/XHC1@14000000/HS01@14100000/SE
    Blank RT Family @14100000/IOUSBHostInterface@0/AppleUserUSBHostHIDDevice'

    This path can be found using the 'ioreg' utility or using 'IO Hardware Registry Explorer' tool.
    However, using the system report from 'About This MAC -> System Report -> USB' a partial path
    can also be gathered. Using the name of USB device from the 'USB Device Tree' and appending
    the 'Location ID' should work. The name can be 'SE Blank RT Family' and the 'Location ID' is
    in form <hex> / <dec>, e.g. '0x14200000 / 18'.
    So the 'usb_id' name should be 'SE Blank RT Family @14200000' and the filter should be able to
    filter out such device.

cube

The 3d graphs in PyX use projectors to transform the 3d data to two dimensions.
Those projectors can be used for other drawing tasks as well, as shown for a
simple cube here. ... In addition to the central projection, a parallel projection
is available, too.

Idea and initial version by Gert-Ludwig Ingold.

### Welcome to ASCII_art!

### Get Started 🚀
<hr>

Not much to say, just go ahead and copy paste the text for your own use or amusement!

<br />

### Usage ⚙
<hr>

Great for school work flaire, or fun personal cli programs. Since this is a dumping ground of art for anyone and everyone though, please don't try to claim other people's work as your own.

<br />

### Contribute 🤝
<hr>

I will look through pull requests consistantly, and will reject any if they have already been done, are deemed *nsfw*, contain offensive language, or use *unicode* characters. Other than that, feel free to `fork`, `commit` your own art entry, and submit a `pull request`.

<br />

### Acknowledgements 💙
<hr>

Will update this section well after `hacktoberfest2020`.

Pytorch Functional is MIT licensed library that adds functional API for model creation to PyTorch.

Defining complex models in PyTorch required creating classes.
[Defining models in Keras is easier](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/functional).
Pytorch Functional makes it just as easy.

With Pytorch Functional, you can create neural networks without tedious calculations of input shape for each layer.

Features:

* Small extension of PyTorch
* No dependencies besides PyTorch
* Produces models entirely compatible with PyTorch
* It is faster or just as fast as equivalent models [(see benchmarks)](https://pytorch-functional.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmarks/)
* Reduces the amount of code you write
* Works well with complex architectures
* Code and documentation is automatically tested

## Example

To create a functional model, you'll use symbolic tensors and nn.Modules.
You can add any layer inheriting from ``nn.Module`` to your model by calling 
``layer(symbolic_tensor)`` or equivalently ``symbolic_tensor(layer)``.

You can create functional model just like in Keras:
by calling the modules and symbolic tensors as if they were normal tensors.
Layers will be automagically registered in your model.

```python
from torch import nn
from pytorch_functional import Input

x = Input(shape=(1, 28, 28))  # Input is a SymbolicTensor
print(x)

x = nn.Flatten()(x)  # Every layer returns another SymbolicTensor
x = x(nn.Flatten())  # This is equivalent
print(x)
```

```
<SymbolicTensor at 0x7faf5779d130; child of 0; parent of 0>
<SymbolicTensor at 0x7fafea899f10; child of 1; parent of 0>
```

Using symbolic tensors, we can define a working classificator in a few lines of code:

```python
from torch import nn
from pytorch_functional import FunctionalModel, Input

inputs = Input(shape=(1, 28, 28))
x = nn.Flatten()(inputs)
x = nn.Linear(x.shape[1], 10)(x)(nn.ReLU())
model = FunctionalModel(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)
model
```

```
FunctionalModel(
    (module000_depth001): Flatten(start_dim=1, end_dim=-1)
    (module001_depth002): Linear(in_features=784, out_features=10, bias=True)
    (module002_depth003): ReLU()
)
```

## Gentle introduction

There's a notebook showing the basic usage of Pytorch Functional. With it you can:

* Learn Pytorch Functional in an interactive way
* See visualizations of graphs that are created under the hood
* Try the package out before installing it on your computer

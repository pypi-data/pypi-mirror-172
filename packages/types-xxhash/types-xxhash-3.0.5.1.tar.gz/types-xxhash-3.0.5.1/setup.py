## Typing stubs for xxhash

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `xxhash` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `xxhash`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/xxhash. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `xxhash` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 3.1.0. Please uninstall the `types-xxhash`
package if you use this or a newer version.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `a9236f9cc93b744e30f7c7d87a2db9476e8ddc84`.

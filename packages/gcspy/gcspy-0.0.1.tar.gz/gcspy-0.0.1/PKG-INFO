# Glasgow Constraint Solver CPMpy Interface

The code in this directory creates a simple Python interface for 
the Glasgow Constraint Solver, primarily intended for use by the [CPMpy](https://cpmpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
modelling library. Essentially it wraps all the relevant functionality in a single
class defined in api.hh, api.cc using only standard library types, and then generates
bindings for the methods using [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (submoduled in the `extern` directory).

## How to install
I've not entirely got the installation process streamlined yet, but the current procedure is as follows.

1. Clone the whole repository, including the pybind11 submodule:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ciaranm/glasgow-constraint-solver.git
```
2. Build the libraries (including the python module) using CMake (the XCSP support is not required):
```bash
cd glasgow-constraint-solver
cmake -S . -B build -DGCS_ENABLE_XCSP=OFF -GCS_ENABLE_CPMPY=ON
cmake --build build
```
3. The `cpmpy/gcspy` directory should now contain a shared library file that can be imported as a python module. Optionally this can now be tested
with some simple python unit tests
```bash
cd cpmpy
python3 gcspytest.py
```
4. To make this available system-wide, or in a virtual environment, the package can now be pip installed:
   (ensure still in the `cpmpy` directory)
```bash
pip3 install .
```

## Packaging for PyPi (untested)
I think that after doing steps 1-3 we should be able to just do:

```bash
python3 -m build
python3 -m twine upload dist/*
```

And then anyone should be able to install the package with simply:
```bash
pip3 install gcspy
```

I'm not sure about the cross-platform compatability of this though, and I haven't tested it yet.

# pkmodel-zxara

TODO:
 - Usage section
 
A Python package for pharmacokinetics modelling of drug delivery systems.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install.

```bash
pip install pkmodel-zxara
```

## Usage 

In a Python shell import the model library. *Emphasis on the underscore in the library name*.

```python
import pkmodel_zxara
```

## Theory

Pharmacokinetics (PK) provides a quantitative basis for describing the delivery of a drug to a patient, the diffusion of that drug through the plasma/body tissue, and the subsequent clearance of the drug from the patientâ€™s system. PK is used to ensure that there is sufficient concentration of the drug to maintain the required efficacy of the drug, while ensuring that the concentration levels remain below the toxic threshold. For an introductory theory, we recommend "Principles of Pharmacokinetics", by Ratain et. al. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK12815/

The model presented discretises the body into several linked, homogeneous compartments through which the concentration of an administered drug is tracked. It allows the user to specify the drug administration protocol, as well as physiological parameters.

pytest-black-ng
============

A pytest plugin to enable format checking with [black](https://github.com/ambv/black).

This is a fork of the original [pytest-black](https://github.com/shopkeep/pytest-black) plugin by ShopKeep Inc to provide an up-to-date version of this plugin.


Requirements
------------

* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)
* [black](https://github.com/ambv/black)

There is a minimum requirement of black 22.1.0 or later.

Installation
------------

```
$ pip install pytest-black-ng
```


Usage
-----

To run pytest with formatting checks provided by black:

```
$ pytest --black
```

The plugin will output a diff of suggested formatting changes (if any exist). Changes will _not_ be applied automatically.


Configuration
-------------

You can override default black configuration options by placing a `pyproject.toml` file in your project directory. See example configuration [here](https://github.com/ambv/black/blob/master/pyproject.toml).



Testing
-------

To run the tests, simply run:

```
$ pytest
$ flake8
```

CI takes care of running this against a selecting of Python versions.

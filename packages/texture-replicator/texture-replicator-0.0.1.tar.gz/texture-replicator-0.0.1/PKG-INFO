# Texture Replicator

Texture replicator is an app that takes a base image and a folder of images, and replicates the folder while replacing all the images with the base image.

## Description

One day, my friends and I were using Dolphin to emulate a popular GameCube game, and my friend Ned suggested that we dump the textures and replace them with pictures of bread. After an hour of tediously copying, rescaling, and renaming one bread image over and over, I decided there must be a better way. So, the Texture Replicator was born. 

I decided to use Python to create this app because it is a powerful language that I am unfamiliar with. I also want to showcase my ability to learn new things and to develop using TDD.

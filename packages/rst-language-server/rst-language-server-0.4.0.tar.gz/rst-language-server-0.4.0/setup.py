See `langserver.org <https://langserver.org/#implementations-client>`_ for a list of implementing clients.\n\n.. _reStructuredText: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html\n.. _Language Server Protocol: https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/\n\nFeatures\n========\nAutocompletion of title adornments\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitalernachschub/rst-language-server/a4c81b4805d8ea913042c82e73eb8bae56e88c58/assets/autocomplete_title_adornments.webp\n\nSections reported as symbols in the editor outline\n\nComparison to other projects\n============================\n\n`rst-mode <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/emacs.html>`_ is part of the docutils project. It provides a lot of rst-related functionality, such as operations on text blocks or helpers for indentation and section titles. However, rst-mode is exclusive to Emacs.\n\n`chrisjsewell/rst-language-server <https://github.com/chrisjsewell/rst-language-server>`_ is much more fully featured than this project. It provides diagnostic messages, navigation to references and definitions etc.\n\nHowever, there seems to be no versioning, releases, or packages that can be simply installed by a user. Moreover, Chris\'s implementation targets Visual Studio Code only, whereas this project tries to support various editors.\n\n\n`lextm/restructuredtext-antlr <https://github.com/lextm/restructuredtext-antlr>`_ was an attempt to use ANTLR to parse reStructuredText into a custom syntax tree. The project is discontinued and archived.\n\nRST Language Server relies on docutils for parsing and its Abstract Syntax Tree.\n\nInstallation and Setup\n======================\nRST Language Server is available as a package on PyPI and can be installed via `pip`:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    $ pip install --user rst-language-server\n\nKate\n----\nUsing RST Language Server with `Kate`_ requires the `LSP Client Plugin`_. Once the plugin is activated in the settings a new settings symbol named *LSP-Client* appears. Click on the section, select the *User Server Settings* tab and paste the following server configuration.\n\n.. code:: json\n\n    {\n        "servers": {\n            "rst": {\n                "command": ["rst-ls", "--client-insert-text-interpretation=false"],\n                "highlightingModeRegex": "^reStructuredText$"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nThis will start RST Language Server when opening any file that is configured to use the reStructuredText syntax highlighting.\n\n.. _Kate: https://apps.kde.org/kate/\n.. _LSP Client Plugin: https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/kate/kate/kate-application-plugin-lspclient.html\n\nNeovim\n------\nThere are numerous ways to use Language Servers in with Neovim. This setup configuration assumes that you use `nvim-lspconfig`_.\n\nTo registers RST Language Server with nvim-lspconfig, add the following lua code before requiring `lspconfig` and calling the corresponding `setup` function of the language server:\n\n.. code::\n\n  -- Register rst-ls with lspconfig\n  local configs = require "lspconfig/configs"\n  local util = require "lspconfig/util"\n\n  configs.rst_language_server = {\n    default_config = {\n      cmd = { "rst-ls" },\n      filetypes = { "rst" },\n      root_dir = util.path.dirname,\n    },\n    docs = {\n      description = [[\n  https://github.com/digitalernachschub/rst-language-server\n  Server implementation of the Language Server Protocol for reStructuredText.\n  ]],\n      default_config = {\n        root_dir = [[root_pattern(".git")]],\n      },\n    },\n  }\n\nNote that this setup currently `requires Neovim Nightly (0.6). <https://neovim.discourse.group/t/how-to-add-custom-lang-server-without-fork-and-send-a-pr-to-nvim-lspconfig-repo-resolved/1170/1>`_\n\n.. _nvim-lspconfig: https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig\n\nEmacs\n-----\nRST Language Server can be used with Emacs via `lsp-mode <https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/>`_. Add the following configuration to your *init.el* in order to start rst-ls in rst-mode:\n\n.. code:: lisp\n\n    (with-eval-after-load \'lsp-mode\n      (add-to-list \'lsp-language-id-configuration\n        \'(rst-mode . "rst")))\n\n    (defcustom lsp-rst-ls-command \'("rst-ls")\n      "Command to start the RST Language Server."\n      :type \'string)\n\n    (require \'lsp-mode)\n\n    (lsp-register-client\n      (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection (lambda () lsp-rst-ls-command))\n                       :major-modes \'(rst-mode)\n                       :server-id \'rst-ls))\n\n\nIs my editor supported?\n=======================\nRST Language Server can be used with any text editor that implements a Language Client. See `this list <https://langserver.org/#implementations-client>`_ of Language Client implementations.\n\nFeature Matrix\n--------------\n+------------------------------------+------+--------+--------+\n| Feature \\\\ Editor                  | Kate | Neovim | Emacs  |\n+====================================+======+========+========+\n| Autocompletion of title adornments | ✔    | ✔      | ✔      |\n+------------------------------------+------+--------+--------+\n| Section symbols                    | ✔    | ✔ [#]_ | ✔ [#]_ |\n+------------------------------------+------+--------+--------+\n\n..

[#] Tested with `company-mode <https://company-mode.github.io/>`_\n\nDevelopment configuration with Kate\n===================================\nThe RST Language Server is executed as a subprocess of the Language Client. Therefore, if we want to see log output in Kate we need to write the logs to a file using the `--log-file` command line option. We also set the log level to `debug` in order to view the JSON-RPC messages exchanged between client and server. Lastly, we configure the `root` (i.e. the working directory of the executed command) to the directory where our source code lives in and use `poetry run` to execute the code in the Git repository:\n\n.. code:: json\n\n    {\n        "servers": {\n            "rst": {\n                "command": ["poetry", "run", "rst-ls", "--log-file=/tmp/rst-ls.log", "--log-level=debug", "--client-insert-text-interpretation=false"],\n                "root": "/path/to/rst-language-server-repo",\n                "highlightingModeRegex": "^reStructuredText$"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n\n.. |supported-versions| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/rst-language-server?style=flat-square\n.. |version| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/rst-language-server?style=flat-square\n.. |license| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/rst-language-server?style=flat-square\n.. |coverage| image:: https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/digitalernachschub/rst-language-server?style=flat-square\n',

"""
Handler for reading data using Python multiprocessing. This creates multiple instances
of the application to run to get around the Python GIL.

This implementation uses Plasma, from PyArrow, as the medium for communicating data
between processes, as putting data on queues generally results in poor performance,
this uses queues to communicate the location of the data in Plasma.

Reading from local storage on a computer with 4 physical CPUs (8 logical), the read
performance is about 15% faster using multiprocessing. This hasn't been tested using
remote storage, which is expected to be significantly faster due to increased IO
wait times associated with remote storage.

As mentioned elsewhere, the goal of this library is not to render graphics.  Loading NWN models would
be for the sole purpose of conversion or in some other asset pipeline.  But who knows, anything is
possible.

There is a lot to do to ensure the completeness and correctness of the ASCII parser.  Binary parsing
will likely never be a feature.

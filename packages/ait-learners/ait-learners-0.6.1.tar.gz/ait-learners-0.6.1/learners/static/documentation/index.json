	"content": "Scenario In this exercise you will investigate abnormal behavior on an Engineering Work Station (EWS). As you investigate, you will also determine steps to mitigate this behaviour. This exercise targets the EWS running within an Instrumentation \u0026amp; Control (I\u0026amp;C) environment.\n Objective This exercise will teach some of the basic tools available for performing investigations and audits on a Windows computer. You will learn skills in this exercise that will be used during the remainder of the lab exercises.\n Exercise Steps \u0026amp; Questions    Step 1 - Log onto the EWS and Start TIA Log on to the EWS using the following credentials:\n Username: iaea Password: iaea  After logging on to the EWS, start the Siemens Totally Integrated Automation (TIA) Portal by double-clicking the TIA Portal V13 icon on the Desktop of the EWS.\nStep 2 - Open the TIA Project Open the process by selecting IAEA_PROCESS in the Open Project Window and then click the Open button.\nStep 3 - Connect to the PLC Click the Online \u0026amp; Diagnostics tab on the left side of the TIA screen. Wait a moment for the screen to update, and then double-click on the PLC_1 icon found in the center of the screen.\nThe display should change to the screen below. This screen displays the online status of EWS/PLC communications. The EWS is now receiving real-time values from the PLC.\nNotice that all the Input/Output (I/O) tags on the right of the screen have green checkmarks by them. This means that the EWS is properly connected to the PLC and receiving real-time values.\nStep 4 - Simulate the HMI Start a local runtime Human Machine Interface (HMI) screen on the EWS. Select Portal view (lower left corner of the window), and at the main menu of the TIA portal, click the Visualization tab on the left side of the screen. Wait a moment for the screen to update and then select the Simulate Device button. Press the Simulate Runtime bullet on the right side of the screen then the Simulate runtime button. It will take a minute to start the simulation runtime and generate the HMI display.\nInteract with the process by clicking on the various buttons found on the HMI screen. You can do this on either the EWS runtime or directly on the HMI touch screen panel.\nQuestions Q1: What different actions can you take when using the HMI? What pump(s) can you start or stop? Are you able to manipulate the output valve?   Q2: Can you fill the tank faster than it can be drained? Can you drain the tank faster than it can be filled? What (percentage) value do you need to set on the output valve to keep the tank filling and draining at the same rate?   Q3: What happens when you press the E-STOP button on the HMI screen? Are you able to operate any part of the control system with the E-STOP activated?   Q4: Does the system work equally well from the HMI runtime on the EWS compared to the HMI touch screen? Are there differences? If so, what are they?   Q5: Press the button that is located on the back (near the bottom) of the I\u0026amp;C case. What effect does this have on the system? Make sure to press the button again to ensure the system works properly.   Step 5 - Run I\u0026amp;C Exercise 1 Open the Firefox browser and click on the Automated Lab Exercise bookmark.

Click on the I\u0026amp;C Exercise 1 icon link. While watching the EWS screen, press the Run Exercise button. Do not log back into the EWS until the next step!\nQuestion Q6: Pause and think about what happened when the button was pressed. Why was the EWS screen locked? Is there any information given to you on the lock screen?   Step 6 - Log back into the EWS Log back into the EWS using the same credentials as before \u0026ndash; username \u0026lsquo;iaea\u0026rsquo; and password \u0026lsquo;iaea\u0026rsquo;.\nQuestion Q7: What has changed? What do you think may have happened? How did the calculator get started? Who started the calculator application?    Hint: You can check the running process on the computer using the Task Manager. This will display the running processes and applications along with information about who started the process. You can start the Task Manager by right-clicking the taskbar and selecting Start Task Manager or by pressing [Ctrl + shift + Esc].\n Step 7 - Review Event Logs On the EWS, review the event log information by building a Microsoft Management Console (MMC):\n Press the [Windows Key + R], and run the following command: mmc.exe. When asked if you want to allow the program to make changes to this computer, click Yes.   Add a Snap-in to view the Windows Logging information. Do this by clicking File, Add/Remove Snap-In\u0026hellip; or pressing [Ctrl+M].\n  In the list of Available snap-ins, select Event Viewer and click the Add button in the middle of the dialogue.\n  When the Select Computer dialogue opens, ensure the Local Computer radio-button is selected and then click OK.   Now click the OK button to close the Add/Remove Snap-ins dialogue box.\n  The MMC console will now have the Event Viewer (Local) available in the Console Root. Expand the Event Viewer tree and determine what information is available. Note: Some Windows Event Logs require Administrator permissions. If you are having difficulty at this time, please notify your instructor.\n  Questions Q8: What information is shown in the Event Viewer? What are the limitations of the various Windows logs?   Q9: Inspect the entries in the Security logs with Event ID 4624. These are interactive logon event logs. Examine the Details of the 4624 events and note the LogonType information (Type 2 Interactive, Type 3 Network, and Type 10 RemoteInteractive). Are you able to identify any remote logon activities? If so, what was the remote IP address?   Q10: How did the User log onto the EWS remotely? Do you expect users to logon remotely?   Step 8 - Review Windows Firewall Logs On the EWS, add the Windows Firewall Snap-in to your MMC Console by performing the same steps when you added the Windows Event Logs: click File, Add/Remove Snap-In\u0026hellip; and then select and add the Windows Firewall snap-in.\nQuestion Q11: Examine the Inbound Rules of the Windows Firewall. What rules could be changed to restrict or disable Remote Desktop logon capabilities?   Step 9 - Disable Firewall Rules Disable the Remote Desktop (TCP-In) rule in the Windows Firewall Inbound Rules.

	"content": "Scenario During this exercise, you will monitor both network traffic and data accesses to identify potentially malicious behaviour on the I\u0026amp;C network. As you understand the normal traffic, changes in network traffic can be identified. The engineering work station (EWS) contains all of the files necessary to setup, configure, and monitor the I\u0026amp;C system. Knowing and understanding the data paths within the I\u0026amp;C environment is necessary to protect EWS\u0026rsquo;s critical assets.\n Objective For the network analysis, this exercise will utilize Wireshark for monitoring and analyzing I\u0026amp;C network traffic to determine what network traffic is normal. Using your network traffic baseline you can quickly identify unexpected traffic. Another objective is to view and modify a firewall configuration.\nWe will be using the following tools during the exercise:\n  Wireshark is a cross-platform open-source network traffic analyzer that supports Linux, Unix, and Microsoft Windows.  IPFire is a distribution of Linux built to function as a network Firewall.  Building on the previous exercises, you will use Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to observe access to the file system of the EWS.\nPrerequisites Log on to the Engineering Workstation (EWS):\n Username: iaea Password: iaea  Verify the EWS Siemens Totally Integrated Automation (TIA) project view and RT (runtime) Simulator windows are open.\n Exercise Steps \u0026amp; Questions    Creating a Network Fingerprint Step 1 - Baseline Network Behaviour On the EWS, start Wireshark by double-clicking the icon located on the desktop and then start the network capture by double clicking on Local Area Connection.\nAfter 1 minute, stop the network traffic collection by clicking the red stop button.\n Local Area Connection: This is the primary connection used by the EWS and is connected directly to the I\u0026amp;C network with the IP address 192.168.0.33. This connection is also a mirror or span port on the switch in the I\u0026amp;C network, which will allow you to view all network traffic on the I\u0026amp;C switch.\n Questions Q1: What type of information do you see? Take detailed notes of the common conversations, including source and destination IP addresses and port numbers, as well as the protocols used.   Q2: Based on the I\u0026amp;C network diagram and your notes, is this traffic what you expected to see? Did you find anything unexpected? Note all of your observations below.   Q3: What is the name of the COTP protocol? What devices are using these IP addresses?    Hint: You can isolate this traffic by applying a Display Filter in Wireshark. A good example of this is:\n ip.addr==192.168.0.33 || ip.addr==192.168.0.1 || ip.addr==192.168.0.2   COTP is an ISO 8073 based protocol that stands for Connection Oriented Transport Protocol. The Siemens specific protocol used in this I\u0026amp;C system is based upon COTP, so Wireshark is able to identify it as such. The lower-level meaning of each packet (i.e. decoding the data portion of the packet) requires specific knowledge and decoding of the Siemens protocol.\n Step 2 - Analyse Abnormal Network Behaviour Clear any Wireshark display filters you may have set by pressing the red X button at the end of the display filter text box.\n Before conducting the next instruction, ensure that the enable MAC Name Resolution is enabled (Edit -\u0026gt; Preferences -\u0026gt; Name Resolution -\u0026gt; Resolve MAC addresses).\n From the Automated Laboratory Exercise Web Server, click the I\u0026amp;C Exercise 2.1 icon link. Make sure you closely monitor Wireshark, and when ready, click the Run Exercise button. After 1 minute stop the network traffic collection.\nQuestions Q4: Is this traffic what you expected to see? Did you find anything new or unexpected?   Q5: What information can you gather from the new packet(s)? Where is this device connected? What is it trying to do? How might you physically locate it?   Step 3 - Examine the I\u0026amp;C Firewall Rules In this step, you will use the I\u0026amp;C network firewall to analyze the unexpected network traffic. To access the firewall interface, follow these instructions:\n On the EWS, open a new tab in Firefox Browse to the firewall configuration page by clicking on the I\u0026amp;C Firewall bookmark or entering https://192.168.0.250:444. To login, use admin for the username, and iaea for the password.  Wait a few seconds for the page to load. For the LAN and DMZ networks, does the main page of the I\u0026amp;C firewall match what you know from your network diagram?\n The green network is the I\u0026amp;C network protected by the firewall.  The orange network is a DMZ for the I\u0026amp;C. The red network is the outside network that is typically connected to a corporate network or the internet.\n From this interface you can view and analyze the firewall rules by clicking on the Firewall menu and selecting Firewall Rules.\nQuestions Q6: Summarize what are these firewall rules doing.   Q7: View the details of a specific rule by clicking the yellow pencil icon, located just to the right of the rule. Write down what each rule is implementing:\nRule 1:  Rule 2:  Rule 3:   Firewall Rule #1 is blocking all outbound connections from the green (I\u0026amp;C) network to the outside (red) network. This all inclusive deny rule is not usually the only rule in a firewall, but this is an example of how strict outbound firewall rules are implemented. Allowed connections will now need to be explicitly added for any outbound traffic.\n Step 4 - Analyze the I\u0026amp;C Firewall Logs To inspect the I\u0026amp;C firewall logs, click the Logs menu and select Firewall Logs.\nQuestions Q8: Do the log entries reflect what you saw in Wireshark? How much information does the log provide? What other ways might you get additional information about network traffic?   Q9: What traffic was trying to get out of the I\u0026amp;C network? Where was it trying to go?   Advanced Exercise Edit rule #1 in the firewall and change the policy from Drop to Reject. Press the update button. One the main firewall rules screen press the Apply Changes button to activate the rule change. Repeat the exercise again by starting a new Wireshark capture and clicking Run Again from the Automated Lab Exercise Web Server.\nQuestions Q10: What happens differently when the rule changes from Drop to Reject? What are some of the different MAC addresses and Destination IP addresses you found? Do they also appear in the Firewall Logs?    Note: The big difference between REJECT and DROP is that REJECT results in a response being returned to the sender by the firewall, whereas a DROP will drop the packet and will not send a response to the sender.\n   Exercise Control Network Fingerprint  Form submitted       Exercise completed          submit          Advanced Scenario - Data Path Analysis  Verify that the EWS Siemens Totally Integrated Automation (TIA) Project View and RT (runtime) Simulator windows are open. Note: If you need help starting TIA and RT Simulator ask your instructor for help.\n Step 1 - Execute an Attack From the EWS perform the following steps:\n Open the Firefox browser and go the Automated Lab Exercise Web Server. Click the I\u0026amp;C Exercise 2.2 icon link and then click Run Exercise.  Question Q11: Did you observe any abnormal behavior on the EWS?   Step 2 - Collect Network Data and Analyze On the EWS, start a traffic capture using Wireshark in the following way:\n Double click the Wireshark icon on the desktop. To start the network traffic capture, double click on Local Area Connection.  From the Automated Lab Exercise Web Server webpage do the following steps:\n Click Run Again. Once the exercise finishes successfully, stop collecting traffic on Wireshark by pressing the red stop button.  Begin analyzing the traffic for any file transfer protocols (e.g. SMB, FTP, TFTP, SSH, etc.). Also identify any remote desktop connections protocols (e.g. VNC, RDP, etc.).\nQuestions Q12: When performing your analysis of the network capture, which protocols did you observe?   Q13: Why could the protocols you identified be a concern for the EWS? Why could the protocols you identified be legitimate?    Note: File transfers and remote desktop connections to and from the Engineering Work Station allow the possibility for transfer or manipulation of sensitive information that is used to configure and operate the I\u0026amp;C system.\n Step 3 - Further Network Analysis Further analyze the SMB network traffic identified in the previous step by using a Wireshark filter for the SMB protocol. To do so, in the display filter box at the top of Wireshark, enter smb and click the right arrow . This will result in only SMB network traffic being shown.\nQuestion Q14: Identify file and directory names and paths within the SMB network traffic. List some of the directory locations shown in the Info column on Wireshark.    Hint: Sort SMB traffic by clicking on the Info header in Wireshark.\n Step 4 \u0026ndash; Locate Affected Files Using the directory paths identified previously, try to locate them on the EWS using File Explorer:\n From the EWS, click the Folder icon on the taskbar to open File Explorer.  Browse through the C:\\Users\\User directory and try to locate directories you identified from Wireshark.  Questions Q15: What is the full path to the base directory that was being copied?  Q16: What do you think is in this base directory?   To confirm your assumptions about the base directory in the previous step, do the following:\n Open the Siemens Project Window (Siemens TIA) from the taskbar. Compare the Title Bar path at the top of the window with the file path identified with Wireshark.  You have confirmed the file transfer in Wireshark was copying the project directory for the Siemens EWS system; determine what allowed the transfer to take place. This can be done by checking what file shares are available on the EWS system by doing the following:\n Inspect the share information by building a Microsoft Management Console (MMC): Press the [Windows Key + R], and run the following command: mmc.exe. When asked if you want to allow the program to make changes to this computer, click Yes. Add a Snap-in to view the Windows Share information, by clicking File -\u0026gt; Add/Remove Snap-In\u0026hellip; or pressing [Ctrl+M]. In the list of Available snap-ins, select Shared Folders and click the Add button.  When the Select Computer dialog opens, ensure the Local Computer radio-button is selected and then click OK. Now click the OK button to close the Add/Remove Snap-ins dialog box. This will open a window showing you the current Shares, Sessions, and Open Files on the system. Select Shares on the left to see what shares are on the system.  Questions Q17: What share allowed this copy to occur?   Note: Shares that end with the $ are system shares and are required by Microsoft Windows.\n Q18: What can be done to prevent this unauthorized copy from happening?   Step 5 - Mitigation Remove the share by stopping it and re-run the exercise.\n Start a new Wireshark network capture Set the Wireshark display filter for SMB On the Automated Lab Exercise Web Server, for the I\u0026amp;C Exercise 2.2, click the Run Again button. Determine if the file transfer was successful, or if it failed. What indicator(s) in the network traffic capture show success or failure?  Question Q19: What value would these Siemens project files have to an attacker?     Exercise Control Data Path Analysis  Form submitted       Exercise completed          submit       "

	"content": "Scenario As a computer security specialist for your organization you are tasked with investigating abnormal I\u0026amp;C process behaviors and determining a possible cause.\n Objective After performing a baseline of normal operational behavior of the system by using trend graphs and network fingerprinting, compare baselines to abnormal operations and identify the malicious source. Methods to monitor, identify, respond, mitigate, and prevent attacks on your own environment will be demonstrated.\nSetup and Background Before continuing with this exercise, be familiar with the following:\n I\u0026amp;C Human Machine Interface (HMI) operation Pump operation Tank level indicators How valve position affects system flow Emergency stop (E-STOP) functionality  Knowing the basic operation of the process will help you better understand the baseline concept of this exercise. If you encounter any problems please ask for help.\nOperating the test system (i.e. High and Low tank alarms, tank level operation, valve positioning, trends, etc.) will provide an understanding of normal operations. By documenting baseline system operations you can recognize when something changes that could be the result of hardware failure, human error, or malicious intent.\nExercise Steps \u0026amp; Questions    Step 1 - Baseline the Process Behaviour Baseline the process using the Trend Graph (Trend_1) tool:\n On the EWS, start with the tank in the full state (95 liters). Empty the tank: Enter 100 for Valve-01 and turn on Pump-01B. Click the F2 button at the bottom of the HMI screen to open the Trend 1 tank level graph.  When the tank is empty (steady horizontal line at 10 liters) click the Stop button at the bottom of the Trend 1 graph window.   Save a screenshot of the graph by selecting the graph window and then using the keyboard combination Alt+PrtScn.\n  Open Microsoft Paint from the desktop or Start menu and paste the screenshot into Paint by clicking the paste icon:\n   Your screenshot should be similar to the following:\n Save the new screenshot to the desktop for future reference by clicking the Menu button in the upper left corner and selecting Save As. Name the file and save it to the desktop. You have now documented the baseline trend behavior for emptying the tank.  Step 2 - Baseline the PLC Network Traffic Baseline the process PLC network traffic using the network finger printing technique learned in the previous I\u0026amp;C exercise.\n  Start a network capture: Open Wireshark and double click on Local Area Connection.\n  Fill the tank: Turn on Pump-01A.\n  Once the tank reaches the high limit and shuts off Pump-01A, stop the Wireshark capture.\n  Filter the network traffic to only show the packets sent by/from the PLC by entering the following display filter into Wireshark: ip.addr == 192.168.0.1\n  In Wireshark, click the Statistics menu and then click Conversations. In the Conversations windows select the IPv4 tab at the top. At the bottom of the window, select the checkbox Limit to display filter to only show PLC conversations.\n  Questions Q1: Use the Wireshark conversations report to list the IP addresses that can be found in unique PLC conversations.    Note: Once completed, this list of unique conversations is the baseline for PLC communications. Any communications outside this list should be cause for concern.\n Q2: Looking back at the previous steps, how can a baseline of the process and PLC communications benefit you`?   Step 3 - Identifying Abnormal Process Behaviour In this step, you will use the screenshot of the trend baseline to identify abnormalities in the process:\n With the tank filled, select Trend (F2) and start a live trend (play button). Empty the tank: Enter 100 for Valve-01 and turn on Pump-01B. Once the tank level begins to trend down, from the Automated Lab Exercise Web Server click I\u0026amp;C Exercise 4.1 and then click Run Exercise. Monitor the trend graph for variances from the baseline as the exercise executes.   Note: This could be done from the I\u0026amp;C touch panel, allowing you to have the baseline screenshot open on the EWS for easy comparison.\n Questions Q3: Did the tank empty as you were expecting? Did the trend graph deviate from your baseline graph?   Q4: What does this deviation or change indicate has happened? What kind of impact could something like this have on an operational environment?   Q5: How would something like this be handled by your organization? Do you have policies or procedures in place to identify, respond, investigate, and mitigate this type of an event?   Step 4 - Identify Abnormal PLC Communications In this step, you will use the baseline of PLC conversations table from Step 2 to identify out-of-band conversations with the PLC:\n Start a network capture: Open Wireshark and double click on Local Area Connection. Fill the tank: Turn on Pump-01A. From the Automated Lab Exercise Web Server click Run Again on I\u0026amp;C Exercise 4.1. When the pump automatically shuts off, stop the Wireshark capture. Filter the network traffic to only show the packets associated with the PLC by entering the following display filter into Wireshark: ip.addr == 192.168.0.1 In Wireshark, click the Statistics menu and then click Conversations. In the Conversations window select the IPv4 tab at the top. At the bottom of the window, select the checkbox Limit to display filter to only show PLC conversations.  Q6: Use the Wireshark conversations report to list the IP addresses that can be found in unique PLC conversations.   Q7: Compare the table above to the baseline table created in Step 2. What are the differences between the tables?   Q8: What do these differences indicate has happened with the PLC? What can be done to validate your assumptions?   Q9: What kind of impact could something like this have on your environment? How would something like this be handled by your organization? Do you have policies or procedures in place to identify, respond, investigate, and mitigate this type of an event?   Q10: (Optional) What was the attack on the process attempting to do?    Note: Feel free to go back and re-run I\u0026amp;C Exercise 4.1 to try and figure out what the attack is trying to do.\n Reference  COTP is an ISO 8073 based protocol that stands for Connection Oriented Transport Protocol. The Siemens specific protocol used in this I\u0026amp;C system is based upon COTP, so Wireshark is able to identify it as such. Understanding the higher layer protocol requires specific knowledge and decoding of the Siemens protocol contained in the data portion of the packet.\n COTP Source @ wireshark.org\n S7COMM is a Siemens proprietary protocol that communicates between PLCs. It is used for PLC programming, exchanging data between PLCs, accessing PLC data from SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems and diagnostic purposes. The S7COMM data comes as a payload of COTP data packets. The first byte is always 0x32 used as a protocol identifier.\n S7Comm Source @ wireshark.org\nStep 5 - More Attack Analysis (Optional) Perform the same steps in this exercise with I\u0026amp;C Exercise 4.2 and 4.3 and determine what those attacks are attempting to do.\nQ11: Use the area below to summarize what the attack for Exercise 4.2 is attempting to do.   Q12: Use the area below to summarize what the attack for Exercise 4.3 is attempting to do.     Exercise Control Baseline Analysis  Form submitted       Exercise completed          submit       "

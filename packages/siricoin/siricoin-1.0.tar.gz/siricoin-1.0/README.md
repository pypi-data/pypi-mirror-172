Siriously, F**K YOU siricoin. Why? Well here it goes.

SiriCoin is censoring the hella outta you. One word against the devs: BAN. One word about a concurent: BAN. One word about previous devs? BANBANBAN!


SIriCoin devs cant code. SiriCoin started out as an 1:1 token of duinocoin, and the main founder, Sanjay simply invited every duinocoin contrib via github into the siricoin repo.
The Code is all written by yanis, an early contributor of siricoin.

Me and some other guys ended up in SiriCoin, we developed alot, I hosted everything and did all the shit Shreyas couldnt, Sanjay was never online

Quick forward: A few weeks later.

We have an fight, about important stuff, and I decide to shut the only (one node) down. Decentralisation? Hell no. I post an message regarding this to announcements? ITS GET DELETED.


The original siricoin devs all banned us, dont wanna talk about the event, all tho we tried to cooperate, even stole some of our source code (Proof? [here](https://github.com/siricoin-project/explorer/). Per the original License, its defently not allowed to change to a MIT license.)

And what about Shreyas and Sanjay? THEY DIDN'T EVEN KEEP A BLOCKCHAIN COPY!


Come join [sirious](https://discord.gg/gkV6EUknkT), where you, won't get censored. We are Sirious.


(Also you can see from all the trolling we did to siricoin how vulnerable they are)

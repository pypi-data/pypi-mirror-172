    The models for the sequential operation of the NanoCET.

    Apart from a :py:mod:`NanoCETPy.sequential.models.experiment` module containing all the methods for running a
    sequential

    there are modified versions of the already exisiting Basler camera and Arduino models.
    A demo experiment class has been added to be able to run the GUI without attached devices.

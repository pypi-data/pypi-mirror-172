The best way to document a bug is to create a new test which demonstrates it. You should do that by adding a new test to:
    ctypesgen/test/testsuite.py
This is *required* for any patches you might provide. You must provide tests to demonstrate your bug fix or enhancement.

All patches will be have to pass unit tests. You can run the tests by running "tox" with no options.

All our Python code is formatted with using the "black" command with a 100 character line length.
    black --line-length 100
You can verify your patch formatting before you submit it by running "tox -e black".

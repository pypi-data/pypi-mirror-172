        :param project_id: Required. ID of your project. Copy it from cinnaroll web app.

            For Keras models, it has to be a tensorflow.keras.Model or its subclass.
            For PyTorch models, it has to be a subclass of torch.nn.Module.
        :param model_input_sample: Required. Something you can pass to your model object's predict function to get
        a prediction.
            For Keras or Tensorflow models, it's an argument to model.predict().
            For PyTorch models, it's an argument to myModel() where myModel is an object of your model class.

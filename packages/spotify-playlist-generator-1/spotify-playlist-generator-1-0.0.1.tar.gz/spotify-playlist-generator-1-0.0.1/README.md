## Usage

This is a simple spotify playlist generator

```python
from spg import spotify_playlist_generator

spotify = spotify_playlist_generator.SpotifyPlaylistGenerator()
songs_list = spotify.get_songs()
spotify.create_playlist()
```

This simple spotify playlist generator generates a playlist on your spotify account after being provided a series of validation tokens and keys from your spotify account, a date and a range of songs you want on your playlist.

The top 1-100 billboard chart songs are then generated and populated on your brand new spotify playlist

# gcal-sync

An asyncio python library for Google Calendar. This library provides a simplified
Google Calendar API that is lighter weight and more streamlined compared to using
aiogoogle, and increased reliability by supporting efficient sync and reading
from local storage. See the [API Documentation](https://allenporter.github.io/gcal_sync/).

This project provides a pydantic model of the fpm package manifest format used
in the `Fortran package manager <https://fpm.fortran-lang.org>`_.


Installation
------------

Install this project with pip

.. code:: shell

   pip install git+https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm-metadata


Usage
-----

You can read a package manifest with your TOML library of choice and construct
a manifest object from it which allows to access all package entries directly
in Python

.. code:: python

   >>> from fpm.metadata import Manifest
   >>> from tomlkit import loads
   >>> with open("fpm.toml") as fh:
   ...     package = Manifest(**loads(fh.read()))
   ...
   >>> package.name
   'fpm'
   >>> package.version
   '0.2.0'

Alternatively, you can use the ``load_manifest`` function to read a package manifest

.. code:: python

   >>> from pathlib import Path
   >>> from fpm.metadata import load_manifest
   >>> package = load_manifest(Path("fpm.toml"))
   >>> package.name
   'fpm'
   >>> package.version
   '0.2.0'

Finally, you can dump a package manifest to a TOML string using the ``dump_manifest`` function

.. code:: python

   >>> from pathlib import Path
   >>> from fpm.metadata import dump_manifest, load_manifest
   >>> package = load_manifest(Path("fpm.toml"))
   >>> print(dump_manifest(package))
   name = "fpm"
   version = "0.2.0"
   ...


Development
-----------

This project is hosted on GitHub at `fortran-lang/fpm-metadata <https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm-metadata>`__.
Obtain the source by cloning the repository with

.. code::

   git clone https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm-metadata
   cd fpm-metadata

We recommend using a `conda <https://conda.io/>`__ environment to install the package.
You can setup the environment manager using a `mambaforge <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge>`__ installer.
Install the required dependencies from the conda-forge channel.

.. code::

   mamba env create -n devel -f environment.yml
   mamba activate devel

Install this project with pip in the environment

.. code::

   pip install .

Add the option ``-e`` for installing in development mode.

The following dependencies are required

- `pydantic <https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/>`__
- `tomli <https://https://github.com/hukkin/tomli>`__ (tests only)
- `requests <https://requests.readthedocs.io>`__ (tests only)
- `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/>`__ (tests only)

You can check your installation by running the test suite with

.. code::

   pytest tests/ --pyargs fpm.metadata --doctest-modules


For code formatting `black <https://black.readthedocs.io/>`_ is used:

.. code:: shell

   black src/ tests/

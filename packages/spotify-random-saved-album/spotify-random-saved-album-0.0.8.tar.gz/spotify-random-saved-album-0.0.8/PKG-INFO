5. Copy `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from the app's main page
	![](pics/2021-11-14-17-32-40.png)

6. Create a new file `/path/to/.env` which will contain the Client ID and Client Secret:
	
	The `/path/to/.env` file should look like this:
	```
	export SPOTIFY_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
	export SPOTIFY_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SEC
	```

    (optional): create and populate `/path/to/.env` with the following commands:
	```bash
	touch .env # creates .env file
	echo "SPOTIFY_ID=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>" >> .env
	echo "SPOTIFY_SECRET=<YOUR_CLIENT_SEC>" >> .env
	cat .env
	```


7. Get the URL of a random saved album:
   	
	(Option A) source the `/path/to/.env` (sets $SPOTIFY_ID and $SPOTIFY_SECRET) and run the `spotify-random-saved-album` command
	```python
	source /path/to/.env && spotify-random-saved-album
	```
	

	(Option B) the variables explicitly and run the script:
	```
	SPOTIFY_ID=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID> SPOTIFY_SECRET=<YOUR_CLIENT_SEC> spotify-random-saved-album
	```



### Notes

You have to pass the OAuth via browser once on the last step.

Personal usecase of this script is to pipe the output (external link) to a browser shortcut which will open a random album.

    Basic object for reading operations with MED sessions.
    
    The constructor opens the MED session (reads basic metadata and opens data files
    for reading).
    
    The destructor closes open files and frees allocated memory.

    Constructor Parameters
    ----------
    session_path: str
        path to MED session
    password: str (default=None)
        password for MED session
    reference_channel (default=first channel in the session, in alphanumeric ordering)
        since different channels can have different sampling frequencies,
        select a particular channel to be used when indexing by sample sample number.

        Read all active channels of a MED session, by specifying start and end times.
        
        Times are specified in microseconds UTC (uUTC), either relative to the beginning of the session,
        or in absolute epoch terms (since 1 Jan 1970).
        Positive times are considered to be absolute, and negative times are considered to be relative.
        
        Examples of relative times:
            First second of a session:
                start: 0, end: -1000000

        Read all active channels of a MED session, by specifying start and end sample numbers.
        
        Sample numbers are relative to a reference channel, which is specified by an optional
        parameter in the constructor.  If no reference channel is specified, then the default is
        the first channel (in alphanumeric channel name).  A reference channel is necessary
        because different channels can have different sampling frequencies, and the same amount
        of time is read for all channels by this function (sample numbers are converted to
        timestamps for the purposes of this function).

        Times are specified in absolute uUTC (micro UTC) time, or negative times can be
        specified to refer to the beginning of the recording.  For example, reading the
        first 10 seconds of a session would look like:
        sess.get_matrix_by_time(0, -10 * 1000000, num_out_samps)

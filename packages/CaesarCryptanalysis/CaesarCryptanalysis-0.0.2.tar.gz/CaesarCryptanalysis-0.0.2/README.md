# Introduction
Hello.<br>
This is a tool to analyze the Caesar cipher.<br>
It is packaged using PyPI.<br>

# Description
First, please create a Caesar cipher at the following site.<br>
Please keep a copy of the Caesar cipher you have created.<br>
Then enter the following program on the terminal and install it.<br>

```
$ pip install CaesarCryptanalysis
```

Then, after running CaesarCryptanalysis, paste the cipher you just copied and press enter.<br>
You will then get 25 cipher decryption results.<br>

# Postscript
In this case, we developed a simple Caesar cryptanalysis application using Streamlit.<br>
I found Streamlit very convenient and easy to use because I could write the program within a ".py file".<br>
I would like to add tools for analyzing other ciphers to this app in the future.<br>

Description: # Introduction
        Hello.<br>
        This is a tool to analyze the Caesar cipher.<br>
        It is packaged using PyPI.<br>
        
        # Description
        First, please create a Caesar cipher at the following site.<br>
        Please keep a copy of the Caesar cipher you have created.<br>
        Then enter the following program on the terminal and install it.<br>
        
        ```
        $ pip install CaesarCryptanalysis
        ```
        
        Then, after running CaesarCryptanalysis, paste the cipher you just copied and press enter.<br>
        You will then get 25 cipher decryption results.<br>
        
        # Postscript
        In this case, we developed a simple Caesar cryptanalysis application using Streamlit.<br>
        I found Streamlit very convenient and easy to use because I could write the program within a ".py file".<br>
        I would like to add tools for analyzing other ciphers to this app in the future.<br>

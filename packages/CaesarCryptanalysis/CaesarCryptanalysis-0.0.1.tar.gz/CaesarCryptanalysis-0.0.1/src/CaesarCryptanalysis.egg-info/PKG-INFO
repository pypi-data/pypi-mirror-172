Description: # Introduction
        This is an application to analyze Caesar ciphers made using Streamlit.<br>
        Download cc.py and run the following in a terminal.<br>
        Then navigate to the local URL that appears.
        ```
        $ streamlit run cc.py
        ```
        
        # Description
        The ciphertext should be generated at the link "Click here to generate ciphertext".<br>
        Enter the Caesar ciphertext in the input field.<br>
        For this example, we will enter the apple ciphertext "Dssoh".<br>
        <img src="input.png">
        
        The result will output 25 candidates as follows.<br>
        There is always a cipher-decrypted plaintext among them.<br>
        In this case, "Apple" is the correct answer, so the 23rd answer is correct.<br>
        <img src="Apple.png">
        
        # Postscript
        In this case, we developed a simple Caesar cryptanalysis application using Streamlit.<br>
        I found Streamlit very convenient and easy to use because I could write the program within a ".py file".<br>
        I would like to add tools for analyzing other ciphers to this app in the future.<br>

MAgent2 is a library for creating 2D environments with very large numbers of agents for conducting research in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. These can look like this:

This is a maintained fork from the original repo- https://github.com/geek-ai/MAgent. The code is significantly cleaned up in many aspects and some unfortunate names have been fixed, but there are no major differences.

This maintainenace was primarily done in the service of the [PettingZoo library](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/PettingZoo). PettingZoo is the easiest way to use environments in this library, and has comprehensive documentation of them.

## Requirements
MAgent2 supports Linux and macOS and Python 3.6+


## Install instructions
You can simply use `pip install magent`

# AUTOLOGBOOK

A python toolkit for the automatic generation of elog entries of SEM analysis.

## Features
- Set a **watchdog** to keep monitoring the status of a project folder. Every new image added to the folder is automatically included in the logbook.
- The script can automatically recognize the origin of the TIFF images. If coming from a FEI/Thermofisher microscope then the specific tags are decoded and included in the logbook.
- A thumbnail png and a full size png copy of all images are also created in order to have easier access from web-browser.
- It connects to the JRC eLog server where the automatically generated protocol entry is uploaded.
- Mirroring option. It is common to have microscope pictures saved locally on the microscope PC and also mirrored on a remote computer. In order for the autologbook to work, the project folder must be on a specific network share that is reachable by the web-server. To facilitate this task, the user can save the images locally and, if the mirroring option is activated, they will be copied directly to the remote data-server.

## Object orientation

There are five basic elements in this project:
1. ``The HTMLObject`` is a very simple subclass of the python object. It is featuring four class members corresponding to the *doc*, *tag*, *text* and *line* of the [``yattag``](https://www.yattag.org/). It also has some generic methods to generate and reset the HTML content of Doc. All objects deriving from a HTMLObject can produce HTML code.
2. The ``Protocol`` is the basic class describing an experimental protocol. It contains a list of samples, a list of attachments and it has a protocol number, name and responsible, the so-called ownership variables.
3. The ``Sample`` is as simple as a collection of ``MicroscopePicture``s and ``Video``s.
4. The most important: the ``MicroscopePicture`` that is actually the crucial point around which the whole protocol documentation is based on. This is characterized by a dictionary containing all important parameters of the images.
5. The last element, the ``Video``, can be considered as a special image. Those are often generated by modern SEM or FIB for example to document the development of a micromanipulation.

### The inheritance tree of the Protocol
As said above, the basic Protocol is an almost empty class which cannot be used directly. It is meant as a prototype for all possible ways an analysis protocol can be implemented.

It's first  daughter class is the **ELOGProtocol**, that is actually implementing the possibility to transfer its content to a running eLog server. This is accomplished thanks to the ``elog`` package provided by [PSI](https://github.com/paulscherrerinstitute/py_elog).

Going down the derivative tree we find the **QuattroELOGProtocol**. This is a specialization of the *ELOGProtocol* because it includes the handling of navigation pictures that other microscopes do not have. The **VersaELOGProtocol** is another specialization of the *ELOGProtocol* very similar to the QuattroELOGProtocol but for the navigation images that are not present.

### The inheritance tree of the MicroscopePicture.
In a similar way we have an inheritance tree for the **MicroscopePicture**.
Each MicroscopePicture and its subclasses must have a unique ID that is used for example in the Protocol Editor to establish a relation between each entry and the YAML customization file.

#### FEIPicture for FEI Microscopes
It's first daughter is the **FEIPicture** where the specific FEI tags are read from the file and some relevant image parameters are then added to the microscope picture and included in the generated protocol.

Subclassed from the *FEIPicture*, we have the **QuattroFEIPicture** and the **VersaFEIPicture** where the ID is retrieved from the file name if it follows a standard naming convention. Moreover, there are two optional image treatments that can be applied on the fly while a FEIPicture is added to the protocol, it is to say the **automatic calibration** and the **automatic databar removal**.
- **Automatic Calibration**. In fact, in TIFF files generated by FEI microscopes the resolution values encoded in the basic TIFF Tags that are used by common imaging software (like *ImageJ*) to calibrate the picture are wrong (always set to 28 x 28 dpi), even if all the required information to perform the calibration is available in the FEI specific TAG sets. Activating the option for automatic calibration (either from the configuration file or from the configuration editor window), the wrong values are replaced with the correct ones, so that all images will be stored on the image server already calibrated for further use. This option is turned **ON** by default.
- **Automatic Databar removal**. Similarly, it is also possible to crop the image on the fly in order to remove the databar. Differently from the calibration, here the cropped image is saved in a separated file (inside a *crop* folder with also a *_crop* in the filename). This is done in order to avoid important data lost. One can access the cropped images directly from the logbook web page. This option in turned **OFF** by default in order to avoid overloading the storage capability.

## Protocol editor and customization
The role of the autologbook package is to build a protocol for the analysis session. The automatic procedure is sorting all acquired elements (navigation and microscope pictures, pdf reports...) in a standard form, but the microscope operator or the final user may want to customize the protocol comments adding some extra information. The best way would be to edit the output HTML page directly on the ELOG server, but this is not possible during the analysis itself, because as soon as a new element is added to the protocol, autologbook will regenerate the complete HTML content and replace it to the existing one on the server. In other words, all modifications made on the HTML directly on the ELOG page while the autologbook watchdog is running, will be sooner or later lost.
A possible solution is to wait until the end of the analysis session before starting doing all the customizations, but this is for sure not really handy.
The solution adopted by the autologbook to let the user customize his protocol is via the ``ProtocolEditor`` dialog. It is activated during the execution of the watchdog by pressing the corresponding push button on the main window.
The protocol editor window is featuring on the left side a TreeView widget where the protocol structure is shown always completed expanded. On the right side, there is a preview widget where thumbnails of images are shown and three text fields for caption, description and extra.
The protocol data model is divided according to sections and samples as in the following scheme:
   - Introduction
   - Navigation images
      - NavImg 1
      - NavImg 2
      - ...
   - Samples
      - Sample 1
         - Subsample 1.1
            - SubSample1.1Img 1
            - SubSample1.1Img 2
         - Sample1Img 1
         - Sample1Img 2
      - Sample 2
         - Sample2Img 1
         - Sample2Img 2
         - ...
      - ...
   - Conclusion
   - Attachments
     - File1
     - File2

While sample names need to be unique, subsample names can be duplicated. Selecting an item from the tree view, the corresponding information are displayed on the right side. For all images it is possible to add a caption along with the description and the extra field available for all items. The user can use simple markdown styling in the description and the extra field. Not all markdown elements will be available, but a great part of it.
When the selected element of the tree is changed, the introduced values are automatically stored in memory and will be used by the autologbook in the next update. Clicking on the Update button, or equivalently pressing CTRL+S, all customization will be saved to the protocol yaml file. This file change will trigger the autologbook watchdog to generate immediately a regeneration of the protocol.

## Configuration settings
All parameters allowing the proper functioning of the tool can be configured either via a configuration file or directly in the GUI via the ConfigurationEditorDialog.
The configuration file (\*.ini) is parsed with the ``ConfigParser`` module.
If started on the command line, the user can select which configuration file to use by using the option *-c* or *--conf-file*.

An experiment file (\*.exp) is also a configuration file where an additional section ``'GUI'`` is added and that contains all the values of the various widgets. In this way the same protocol can be regenerated in a few mouse clicks.

# Installation
Installation of the **AUTOLOGBOOK** is extremely easy and it is based on ``pip``. The procedure to follow is slightly different if you intend to just to use the package or if you want to work on its development.
Both approaches are described here below.

## Ready to use installation
If you follow this procedure you won't be able to modify the package source and you will just use it as it is or include it in your package as a library.
The best approach is to isolate all your installations in a separate enviroment so not to corrupt any other working tools.
```bat
rem Generate a fresh environment
python -m venv autologenv
cd autologenv
rem Activate the enviroment
Scripts\activate.bat
rem Just install latest autologbook version from PIP
pip install autologbook
```

For running, autologbook needs that a few dependencies to be fulfilled. You don't have to worry about this because pip is taking care of the task, but here below a list of requirements is reported just for you to know.

### Requirements
The autologbook package has been developed with python 3.9.7. In principle, it should be working also with other versions, but it was never tested.
Here is a list of the most important packages needed for execution of the autologbook.
  - py_elog  v1.3.14  --> To interface to the ELOG server (see [note](#a-note-about-elog)).
  - yattag   v1.14.0  --> To generate the HTML content of the protocol.
  - PyQt5    v5.15.7  --> The GUI.
  - Markdown v3.4.1   --> To format the custom HTML content.
  - watchdog v2.1.9   --> To automatize the mirroring process and the addition of new elements to the protocol.
  - tenacity v8.0.1   --> To stabilize the watchdog execution against intermittent problems and network overloads.
  - Pillow   v9.2.0   --> To manipulate images.
  - PyYAML   v6.0     --> To store custom protocol information.

The complete list of requirements is included in the requirements.txt file distributed with the package. However, if the user decides to install ``autologbook`` via ``pip`` [link](#ready-to-use-installation), the installation procedure will take care of installing all needed dependencies.

### A note about ELOG
The official package developed by PSI is only available for conda installation. I have created a fork of the original repository and made all the changes to have it available also as a standalone python package available on PyPI. At the time of writing this README, the maintainer of the official elog python module took the ownership of the PyPI entry.

Starting from autologbook version v0.0.1.b.7, a timeout mechanism has been implemented for each request call (both post and get). This timeout has been implemented in the elog module and a pull request has been submitted to the official [repository](https://github.com/paulscherrerinstitute/py_elog/pull/37) and it is still waiting for revision, approval and actual merging. Until then, the patched version of the latest 1.3.14 release is available as source on our [fork](https://github.com/abulgher/py_elog/tree/timeout).
Since the patched version is backward compatible, using the not-patched official elog package will not crash autologbook, but it will not be protected against network timeouts.

## Install in development mode
Pip allows you to install a package in development mode so that you can have it install in your environment but at the same time you can keep to modify its source.
Here is a simplified procedure.
```bat
rem Generate a fresh environment
python -m venv autologenv
cd autologenv
Scripts\activate.bat
rem Get the source code from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/abulgher/autologbook.git
rem Install the requirements for development purpose
pip install -r autologbook\requirements-dev.txt
rem Install the package in development mode
pip install -e autologbook
```

## Execution
To run the autologbook module you just need to activate your python enviroment and enter the commands as here below.
```bat
rem Create a dedicated enviroment if you don't have it already
py -m venv myenv
cd myenv
rem Activate your python enviroment
Scripts\activate.bat
rem Install the autologbook module
pip install autologbook
rem Start the GUI
python -m autologbook
```

Using ``python -m autologbook -h``, you can get a list of command line options and flags to be used.

# The ELOG counterpart
autologbook is posting logbook entries to ELOG and while the connection details (hostname, port, username...) and the microscope specific logbook are parameters that can be adjusted by the user via the configuration file, the logbook structure is hardcoded and cannot be modified without having to recode large fraction of the code.

The expected logbook structure is shown in this image:
![elog-counterpart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12378877/188565458-fa8df239-5ffd-4dd1-bcc4-60b2cee520f1.PNG)

When creating a dedicated logbook for a microscope to be used with autologbook, its structure must reflect this image and can also be copied from this elog configuration file snippet:
```
Theme = default
Comment = Logbook of Quattro analyses
Time format = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
Date format = %Y-%m-%d
Display mode = summary
Summary lines = 0
Reverse Sort = 1

;------------- Define here all the attributes -------------------
Attributes = Operator, Creation date, Protocol ID, Project, Customer, Edit Lock
Required attributes = Operator, Protocol ID, Project, Customer


;---------- OPERATOR
Preset Operator = $long_name
Subst Operator = $long_name

;---------- CREATION DATE
Type Creation date = date
Preset Creation date = $date

;---------- Protocol ID
Comment Protocol ID = Please provide the numeric digits of the protocol

;---------- Project
Comment Project = Please provide the project name (usually the second part of the folder name)

;---------- Customer
Comment Customer = Please provide the customer name (usually the third part of the folder name)

;---------- Edit Lock
ROptions Edit Lock = Protected, Unprotected
Preset Edit Lock = Unprotected
Comment Edit Lock = Use this switch to protect the entry against accidental automatic editing.


List display = ID, Creation date,  Operator,  Protocol ID, Project, Customer
Link display = ID
Quick filter = Protocol ID, Project, Customer
```
## The Edit Lock
Starting from release v0.0.1.b.1, an Edit Lock flag has been introduced in the eLog structure. This is meant to protect an elog entry from accidental automatic editing. For example, after an elog entry has been generated with the autolog, the user decided to customize its content using the web editor interface instead of the Protocol Editor GUI. If the autologbook watchdog will be started again in the same folder, the standard HTML protocol will be generated and will replace the user customized one. In order to protect against this automatic re-editing, the user can set the Edit Lock to **Protected** and the autologbook will consider this entry as read-only.

When a read-only entry is found, the user is asked to decide what to do, (s)he may want to override the read-only flag regenerating the HTML content from the original protocol content, or to back up the read-only entry and generate a new one for the current protocol, or, as a last option, to change the protocol identification number for the current experiment.

**WARNING**. The check of the read-only flag is performed only before the watchdog is started. This means that if the user is setting protecting the entry while the watchdog is still running, this will be totally ignored.

# The labtools
Along with the main automatic logbook generation, the package comes with a series of useful labtools executables (mainly CLI, but also GUI). Those executables will be available in the Scripts directory of your virtual enviroment.

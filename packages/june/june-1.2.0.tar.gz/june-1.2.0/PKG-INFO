# JUNE: open-source individual-based epidemiology simulation

This is the offical repository of JUNE, named after [June Almeida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Almeida), who was the female Scottish virologist that first identified the coronavirus group of viruses. A paper introducing our modelling framework in the case of modelling the spread of COVID-19 in England has been published in [Royal Society Open Science](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.210506).

Please cite our paper as follows:

# Setup

The easiest way to get JUNE up and running is to install the latest stable version,

```
pip install june
```

and download the data by running the script:

```
get_june_data.sh
```

If the above fails, then manually clone the repo and run the script ```scripts/get_june_data.sh```.


Disclaimer: All the data is constructed by mixing different datasets from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), thus it may contain modifications. Please refer to the original source (cited in the [release paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.15.20248246v1)) for the raw dataset.

This will require a working installation of Open MPI or Intel MPI to compile ``mpi4py``. 

If you want to get the most up-to-date version of the code, then you can clone this repository, and install it using

```
pip install -e .
```

This should automatically install any requirements as well. You can then get the data using the same command as the pip version.

## Conda installation (generally optional but required for M1 chip Macs)

As an alternative to the above, you can use conda:


    conda create -n june_env python=3.8 -y # need 3.8 for some deps
    conda activate june_env

    python --version

    conda install -y numba
    conda install -y -c anaconda hdf5

    python3 -m pip install -r JUNE-private/requirements.txt
    python3 -m pip install -r june_runs/requirements.txt

    pushd JUNE-private
    python3 -m pip install -e .
    popd

    pushd june_runs
    python3 -m pip install -e .
    popd


    # Change to fit your environment
    export INSTALL_DIR=$HOME
    # For Hartree
    #export INSTALL_DIR=$HCBASE/miniconda_base

    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p $INSTALL_DIR/miniconda
    source $INSTALL_DIR/miniconda/bin/activate

### Notes for using Hartree and Cosma clusters

To download and setup conda:

    # Change to fit your environment
    export INSTALL_DIR=$HOME
    # For Hartree
    #export INSTALL_DIR=$HCBASE/miniconda_base

    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p $INSTALL_DIR/miniconda
    source $INSTALL_DIR/miniconda/bin/activate


Then you will need to load OpenMPI, e.g -


    # Hartree: module load openmpi-gcc/2.1.1
    # Cosma: module load openmpi/3.0.1 gnu_comp/7.3.0

After this follow the instructions above for conda installation.

To activate it, use:

    . $HOME/miniconda/bin/activate
    # For Hartree
    #. $HCBASE/miniconda_base/miniconda/bin/activate
    
    conda activate june_env


## Installation FAQs

**Q:** I get errors with using mpi4y on a Mac<br/>
**A:** Try using homebrew to install the software by running: ``brew install mpi4py``. If working in a conda environment, 
use `pip install mpi4py` instead of `conda install`, as the latter will also install additional MPI-related packages that could prevent
your MPI paths from being correctly found.

**Q:** I get building errors for h5py, mpi4py and tables when trying to ``pip install -e .``<br/>
**A:** Try installing these packages (e.g., with ``conda install`` if working in a conda environment, but see above caveat for mpi4py) 
*before* attempting the full pip install, while enforcing the versions listed in the ``requirements.txt``. 
This may help to avoid incompatibilities with the hdf5 on your system (if any).
  

# How to use the code

Have a look at ``Notebooks/quickstart.ipynb`` for a gentle introduction to how JUNE works. You can also check out some scripts in ``example_scripts``.

The ``docs`` directory contains the source files and HTML outputs to
display all information auto-generated from the `june` codebase docstrings,
including auto-generated class and module diagrams.

# Tests

Run the tests with:

```
cd test_june
pytest
```

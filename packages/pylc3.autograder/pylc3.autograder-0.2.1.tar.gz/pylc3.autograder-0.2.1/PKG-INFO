Description: ================
        pylc3.autograder
        ================
        
        Autograder framework for LC-3, based off liblc3 and pylc3.core
        
        Exports test results in JSON. JSON output format is configurable.
        Note that this doesn't export a grade in the JSON. A user script can then easily parse the
        JSON and then assign points per each assertion passed.
        
        For autograder examples see https://github.com/complx-tools/pylc3.autograder.examples

This library is an abstraction for Splunk-related development, maintenance, or migration operations.
It provides a single CLI or SDK to conveniently perform various operations such as managing a local
development container, retrieving sample-data, building applications, comparing instances, managing
knowledge objects and hopefully much more in the future.

## Motivation üî•

When I work with Splunk, my working directory is usually in the same layout. I work with a
mono-repository or a higher-level one with submodules, which contains several applications and
configuration. This can look generalized like this:

```
<Development Repository>
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps                          # Folder where to store applications
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Defender_TA_nxtp          # Generic custom Splunk app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dist                          # Place for built packages and reports
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config                        # Settings and secrets
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.yaml             # General purpose settings for this lib
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .secrets.yaml             # API settings for connections and secrets
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ share                         # Custom splunkbase or builtin app content
```

We have all found our ways and methods to develop applications on an instance and to configure and
operate that instance to meet our needs and/or those of our customers. But what is usually rather
painful is when we then need them on other instances as well. A good example are test instances,
which should be as close to production as possible. However, in the last few years that I have been
dealing as a user with Splunk, some needs for simplified handling and automation have emerged that I
would like to address here.

### We want to ...

- Spin up a local development container:

  ```bash
  spl docker start
  ```

- Put my local application(s) there for testing purposes:

  ```bash
  spl docker upload --app="Defender*"
  ```

- Get sample data for Eventgen:

  ```bash
  spl --src="onprem"  samples --path="./apps/SA-Eventgen" download --name="WinDefender"
  ```

- (De)activate streaming of event data.

- Download apps from development container to local folder:

  ```bash
  spl docker download --app="Defender*"
  ```

- Run AppInspect, Packaging, etc.:

  ```bash
  spl apps --name="Defender_TA*" validate
  ```

- List various objects on an instance:

  ```bash
  spl manager --conn="onprem" users list
  ```

- Create or modify objects on an instance:

  ```bash
  spl manager --conn="onprem" roles update --name "investigator"
  ```

- Sync objects and their properties from one instance to another:
  ```bash
  spl --src="onprem" --dest="localhost" sync users --create --update
  ```

and probably much more, so pull requests are welcome!

## Getting Started üöÄ

You can download the package from the package feed via `pip install spl-manager` or install from
source with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) after cloning the repository.

Then you can issue your first command to get the help page:

```bash
python -m spl -h
```

or `poetry run python -m spl -h`. Anyhow it's recommended to set the `alias spl="python -m spl` for
easier handling.

You have to create a `config\.secrets.yaml` file by using the `config\template.secrets.yaml` file,
which contains the credentials for the Development Docker-Container and Splunkbase.

## Using the library üìö

Please note that, when using the library as an SDK you need to pass the `interactive=False` flag to
not run into issues because in _interactive_ mode it asks for user inputs via CLI methods.

```python
from spl import SplManager

spl = SplManager(interactive=False)
```

## Using the CLI üßë‚Äçüíª

If you wish to get more information about any command within `spl`, you can pass the `-h` parameter.

### Top-level `spl` Options

- `--interactive`: Wether or not to run in interactive mode.
- `--src`: The name of the source connection provided in settings.
- `--dest`: The name of the destination connection provided in settings.

### Top-level `spl` Modules

- `connections` provides you a list of connections available via configuration.

- `docker` helps you to manage the local splunk container instance.

- `apps` abstracts the handling of local application folders at a given `--path` and helps with
  validation, packaging, vetting, etc.

- `samples` are based on the configured queries for a `--conn` or `--src` and can download results
  and store them automatically at a `--path` to use for _SA-Eventgen_.

- `manager` acts as a direct `ConnectionAdapter` interface for the specified `--conn` parameter.

- `sync` will handle `manager`s for `--src` and `--dest` connections, enabling you to compare, move
  and update between those instances.

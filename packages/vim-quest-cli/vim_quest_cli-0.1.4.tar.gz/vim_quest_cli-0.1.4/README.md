# VimQuestCLI

TODO : 

- Have vim as executor. So I can compare for tests.
- Have a context that is not a copy but modify itself (for speed).
- Have a bunch of hooks, and use them to have game modes.
- Have a command to choose between game modes.
- See how neovim is made so I can use the same architecture.
- Syntax highlighting for python.
- Maybe have syntax highliting for game modes too ?
- Solve the ANSI speed.
- Activate the UTF-8, see how I can activate it.
- Create docker images for website and terminal.
- 

SPLIT projects :

- VimQuestCLI for python cli version.
- Bundle to have python bundle pypy project.
- Using bundle and transform it into javascript => deploy onto mpm.
- Javascript website to deploy.

BUG CORRECTION :
- Clean codebase.
- ANSI is blinking.
- Image location is not working.
- Size of the terminal is not used.
- Unicode block behavior is inconsistent.
  - Maybe having replacement for unicode that include colors.

# inorqm

`inorgqm` is a python module for working performing quantum mechanical calculations using phenomenological spin operators

# Installation

For convenience, `inorgqm` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/inorgqm/) and so can be installed using `pip`

```
pip install inorgqm
```

first import it into your python file

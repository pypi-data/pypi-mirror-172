# ![iquaflow](https://github.com/satellogic/iquaflow/raw/main/docs/source/iquaflow_logo_mini.png) <br /> An image quality framework

iquaflow is an image quality framework that aims at providing a set of tools to assess image quality. One of the main contributions of this framework is that it allows to measure quality by using the performance of AI models trained on the images as a proxy. The framework includes ready-to-use metrics such as SNR, MTF, FWHM or RER. It also includes modifiers to alter images (noise, blur, jpeg compression, quantization, etc). In both cases, metrics and modifiers, it is easy to implement new ones. Adittionaly, we include dataset preparation and sanity check tools and all the necessary tools to carry new experiments. 

Usage examples and a detailed description of our framwework can be found within [our documentation](http://iquaflow.readthedocs.io/) on Read the Docs.

## Installation

You can install iquaflow using pip:

```
pip install iquaflow 
```

Read more complete installation instructions at [our documentation](http://iquaflow.readthedocs.io/).

iquaflow is a pure Python library, and therefore should work on Linux, OS X and Windows
provided that you can install its dependencies. If you find any problem,
[please open an issue](https://github.com/satellogic/iquaflow/issues/new)
and we will take care of it.

The package is written in Python. however, the repo also includes JavaScript.\n\nIf you find visual illusions fascinating this package is for you. You can reproduce the illusions in the literature with a few lines of code.\n\nMore importantly, we shouldn\'t take optical illusions as just fun. Optical illusions help us to research how the visual system of the brain ,which is the most complex mechanism, processes such cues. Most of the optical illusions in this package are seriously researched in the neuroscience literature. And I must say that the "causation" of the most of effects is still debated in the literature according to my humble knowledge. Optical illusions are researching not only in human vision but in other animals. So we can get a lot of insights from an evolutionary perspective.\n\nIn summary, I think this topic is very important, especially in vision studies.\n\nFor all optical illusions check this documentation: [altunenes.github.io/sorceress/](https://altunenes.github.io/sorceress/)\n\n### Getting started🚀️\n\nPackage can be found on pypi hence you can install it via pip.\n\n```\npip install sorcer\n```\n\n```\n#importing\nimport sorceress\n#another way to import \nfrom sorceress import sorceress\n```\n\n### Features\n\n[For the API, click here](https://altunenes.github.io/sorceress/api_reference/)\n\n+ Illusions in Python\n  - chromatic\n  - dotill\n  - realtimegrid\n  - addlines\n  - eyecolour\n  - dakinPex\n  - bruno\n  - dolboeuf\n  - kanizsa\n  - tAki2001\n  - cafewall\n  - ccob\n  - ebbinghaus\n  - whiteill\n  - enigma\n  - blackhole\n  - colorgrids\n+ **Illusions in JavaScript**\n\n- footsteps\n- thelilac\n- EyeMovements\n- spatialmotion\n\n## Examples\n\n[In this page](https://altunenes.github.io/sorceress/explanations%20of%20illusions/), you can find all illusions, explanations, code and how to use. I show just few examples on this page.\n\n```\nfrom sorcerer import sorcerer\nsorcerer.chromatic("myimage.jpg","outputname" ,circle=False, method="CMCCAT2000", gif=True, Gifduration=7)\nsorcerer.addlines("myimage.png","desiredoutputname",linecolour1=(0,255,0),linecolour2=(0,255,255),linecolour3=(255,0,0))\n```\n\n## Contribution\n\nAny contribution, bug report, suggestion is always welcome.\n\n##Author\n\n+ Main Maintainer: Enes Altun\n',

# Python client for NGD Backend 

A Python client package to operate with NGD-Backend

NGD Backend purpose is to manage and process Bar Code of Life information, applied to decision-making in conservation of biodiversity. 
It is a software system (a set of software components) developed as part of project "NEXTGENDEM" activities. 
BCS-Backend is the main component, an engine capable of managing bioinformatic information 
(import, export, visualization) and providing easy access to bioinformatic processes by filling parameters and submitting to available compute resources.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

* Python >= 3.8
* An NGD backend instance has to be running and accessible. The URL of the API endpoint is the required parameter for the construction of the client. See the example in "Basic Usage" section below.
* An API Key to authenticate into the NGD Backend instance (go to the GUI of NGD and request and download an API Key file)

### Installing 
```bash
pip install ngd-biond
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from biond import Client

c = Client("http://localhost:5000/api")  # Construct client
c.check_backend_available()
c.login(
    "api_key_file.txt")  # Login, using API Key in a file (direct API key not supported to avoid unintended upload of API keys)
c.logout()
```

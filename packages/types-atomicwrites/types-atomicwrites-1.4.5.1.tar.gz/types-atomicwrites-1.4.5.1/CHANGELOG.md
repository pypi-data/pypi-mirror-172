## 1.4.5.1 (2022-10-17)

Mark `atomicwrites` as no longer updated (#8912)

[`atomicwrites`](https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites) is a package that's only really useful for Python 2/3 compatibility. It's now deprecated, archived, and unmaintained. Prior to #8883 a few days ago, marking the stubs as complete, the typeshed stubs hadn't received any significant updates for several years.

I propose we mark the stubs as no longer updated, and then remove them.

## 1.4.5 (2022-05-07)

Import generics from standard modules in all third-party stubs (#7791)

## 1.4.4 (2022-04-27)

Remove Python 2 support from atomicwrites (#7712)

## 1.4.3 (2022-01-08)

Use lowercase `type` everywhere (#6853)

## 1.4.1 (2021-10-12)

Add star to all non-0.1 versions (#6146)

## 1.4.0 (2021-09-19)

Update third-party package versions (#5996)

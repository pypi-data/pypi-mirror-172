# Thesaurus Visualization

Current supported languages are:

- English ``eng``
- Russian ``rus``

## How to run
### Minimalistic way
Install the library:
```
pip install thesaurus-lib
```
Create an object and specify the language:

```
obj = Thesaurus(lang='eng')
```
Show output:

```
obj.show_map()
```
### Run with your own foregrounds:
After you install the library and create the object do the following

1. pass them to the library:

```
text1 = obj.read_pickle('2017')
text2 = obj.read_txt('shakespeare.txt')
text3 = obj.read_text('My foreground in string format')
```
2. Preprocess your foreground:

```
texts = dict()
foreground_name = 'Physics articles 2017'
texts[foreground_name] = obj.custom_preprocessing_of_data(text1)
```
3. Process foregrounds:

```
processed_foregrounds = obj.process_foreground(foreground_names, texts)
```
4. Show output:

```
obj.show_map()
```

### Use your own configurations

After installing the library create a file called 'config.cfg' in your working
directory and fill the value with your own files:

```
[paths]
som_path =
index_path =
back_tokens_path =
back_embeds_path =
stopwords_path =
foregrounds_path =

    [lang]
    som_url =
    embeds_url =
    som_file =
    index_file =
    back_tokens =
    back_embeds =
    embeddings_file =
    STOPWORDS_FILE =
    model =
```

Note: Don't leave any empty field in config.cfg. For example if you aren't providing a som_file
then delete it in your config.cfg and don't keep it in this way:

```
# fill it or delete it
som_file =
```

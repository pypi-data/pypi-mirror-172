ArXiv Update CLI
================
Fetch new articles on arXiv by keywords and authors.

CLI tool to fetch new articles on arXiv in selected categories (e.g. quant-ph) filtered by keywords or authors.
The updates can also be sent by email so that the script can be run automatically with `cron <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron>`_.

The script will fetch the articles on arXiv that

 +  were *submitted/updated* after the last update date (or the provided date, see ``--since`` option)

 **AND**

 + belong to one of the *categories*

 **AND**

 + (one of the *authors* is in the author list) **OR** (one of the *keywords* is in the title or abstract)

All the *options* are set in the configuration file. Note that keywords can contain spaces, e.g. *machine learning*.

Thank you to arXiv for use of its open access interoperability.

Dependencies
------------

- Python 3
- `feedparser <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/feedparser>`_
- `keyring <https://pypi.org/project/keyring/>`_ (optional): Store password of email account in system keyring (for the ``--email`` option)


Install
-------

The script can be installed with pip

::

    $ pip install arxiv_update_cli

or by downloading the source code and running

::

    $ python setup.py install

from within the folder.


For Archlinux users, there is a ``PKGBUILD`` file in ``packaging_archlinux/``.


Launch
------

Execute ``arxiv-update-cli``, or if the package is not installed, execute ``arxiv_update_cli.py`` with python.

Options:

  ====================================  ===================================================================================
  \-h, \-\-help                         show the help message and exit

  \-e, \-\-email                        send result by email using SMTP (you will be prompted for missing settings)

  \-s YYYY-MM-DD, \-\-since YYYY-MM-DD  fetch update since YYYY-MM-DD 00:00

  \-c [FILE], \-\-config [FILE]         config file to use or print path to default one and exit if no argument is provided

  \-v, \-\-version                      show version and exit

  \-\-log                               show path to log file and exit
  ====================================  ===================================================================================

If no configuration file exists, one will be created. Then, you can edit the
*categories*, *keywords* and *authors* fields and run the script again.


Automatic execution
-------------------

Once the email setttings have been configured and the password saved in the keyring, regular executions of ``arxiv_update_cli`` can be scheduled. For instance, one can receive daily email updates at 9:30 on working days with the following `crontab <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron>`_ (Unix)

::

    30 09 * * 1-5 arxiv-update-cli -e


Troubleshooting
---------------

Errors are logged in the file ``arxiv_update_cli.log`` in the system's temporary folder. Use the ``--log`` option to display the path.

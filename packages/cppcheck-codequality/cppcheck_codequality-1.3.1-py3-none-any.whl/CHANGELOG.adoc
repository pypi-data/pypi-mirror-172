üì¶ https://pypi.org/project/cppcheck-codequality/1.2.0/[PyPi]

* [https://gitlab.com/ahogen/cppcheck-codequality/-/issues/6[#6]]
  Fix "run as module" usage by splitting the singular `\__init__.py` into `\__init__.py` and `\__main__.py`.
* CI now tests against py36, py37, py38, py39
* Added support for pointing to source code directories.
* Remove CWE URL from content: body.
  I don't think it has been very useful over the last year.
  Not exposed in GitLab MRs and just makes the JSON file larger.
* Log warning message if `ConfigurationNotChecked` rule (from CppCheck) is seen in the input XML.
* Log number of issues written to output.
* Remove `[cppcheck]` prefix from JSON `description` field. Move to `check_name` field.
** Was added in v1.1.0
** It takes up space in GitLab MRs. Removing, so devs see more useful info.
** Moved to `check_name` field, thinking if folks want to concatenate JSON reports
   from https://gist.github.com/caryan/87bdadba4b6579ffed8a87d546364d72[other tools],
   it may be useful to debug what analysis tool generated the issue.

Improve JSON report output with severity field

* [https://gitlab.com/ahogen/cppcheck-codequality/-/issues/3[#3]]
  Add 'severity' field.
* Remove CppCheck's severity from the JSON 'categories' list
* [https://gitlab.com/ahogen/cppcheck-codequality/-/issues/2[#2]]
  Add "[cppcheck]" prefix to issue message, to quickly identify the
  tool which produced the warning. May put this in 'engine_name' field
  in the future, but GitLab won't show that in MRs. So prefix the issue
  message for now.

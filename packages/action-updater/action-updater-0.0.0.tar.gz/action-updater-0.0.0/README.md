# Action Updater

[![GitHub actions status](https://github.com/vsoch/action-updater/workflows/main/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/vsoch/action-updater/actions?query=branch%3Amain+workflow%3Amain)

The actions updater will make it easy to update actions:

 - ü•ë updated syntax and commands
 - ü•ë versions of actions, either for releases or commits
 - ü•ë preview, write to new file, or write in place!

A few example commands are provided below (until we need more official documentation)!

üöß **under development!** üöß 

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Usage ‚≠êÔ∏è

For all commands below, the actions updater can accept a directory with yaml files,
or a single yaml file. To start, we expect a directory with yaml or a direct path
to a yaml file. Every yaml file provided must match the [GitHub actions schema](https://github.com/softprops/github-actions-schemas/blob/master/workflow.json),
until there is proven reason to not require this.

### Settings

The library ships with it's own default settings, provided at [action_updated/settings.yml](action_updated/settings.yml) and you are free to update these directly alongside the install,
provide a settings file:

```bash
$ action-updater --settings-file /path/to/my-settings.yml <command>
```

or init your own settings to customize in your user home.

```bash
$ action-updater config inituser
Created user settings file /home/vanessa/.action-updater/settings.yml
```

And then edit that file instead. It will be used instead. You can look at settings
per [updater](#updaters) to see what can be customized.


### Detect

The detect command can be run on any action file (or folder) to determine
if you have old syntax or action versions.

```bash
$ action-updater detect .github/workfows/main.yaml
```

It will print to the terminal the updated file for preview.

### Update

An update command performs a detect, but then writes changes to the file.

```bash
$ action-updater update .github/workfows/main.yaml
```

For either of the `update` or `detect` commands, turn off details by
adding the `--no-details` flag. Also for both, exporting a `GITHUB_TOKEN`
will increase API limits for any checks of tags/releases. 

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/vsoch/action-updater) if you'd like 
to see other functionality or updaters!

## Updaters

Each updater:

- Is provided as a directory under [action_updater/main/updaters](action_updater/main/updaters).
- Is allowed a settings.yml entry under `updaters` and the directory name
- Can provide it's own custom schema to validate the entry

And has those defaults and other metadata briefly documented here!

### Version

The version updater is intended to update actions uses in steps. Specifically:

 - For "trusted" orgs (those under `orgs_major` attribute in the updater settings) we use major versions (e.g., `actions/checkout@v3`)
 - For all others, we find the latest release tag, and then use the commit (and add a comment for the tag)

These are the defaults. To remove trusted repos, empty this list. If you want
other functionality, please [open an issue](https://github.com/vsoch/action-updater/issues).


### Developing an Updater

Each updater is required to have one file, `update.py` that uses the `UpdaterBase` class and
has one function to `detect`. The function should expect an action (`action_updater.main.action.GitHubAction`) to be provided, and to look through the `action.jobs` and make any appropriate changes. The client will handle displaying changes and otherwise saving updates. This
is a brief description and not comprehensive - it's recommended to copy an existing example,
and then it will be automatically detected and registered. If you'd like to request more detailed
documentation please [open an issue](https://github.com/vsoch/action-updater/issues).

As the main purpose of my anonymization tool is to mask personal names, sentences that do not contain personal names were removed. Due to the long run time required by packages like flair, only 1000 sentences were used for the final evaluation. 

### Final Data Distribution 

The 1000 sentences used for the final evaluation can contain varying number of words, ranging from 3 words to 112 words. Most of the sentences contain around 13 to 23 words

In addition, most of the sentences used in the final evaluation contain only 1 personal name(Identified by [Name] in the expected output). There is 1 sentence with 16 personal names.

### Union and Intersection of Packages 

In the tool, users can either use any of the packages mentioned above or choose to have an intersection/union among the packages. 

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Mary Lee ate pasta. She met Anna at the restaurant.]-->B{{Choice of Package}};
  B -- NLTK --> C["[Name] Lee ate pasta. She met [Name] at the restaurant."];
  B -- spaCy --> D["[Name] ate pasta. She met Anna at the restaurant."];
  B -- flair --> E["[Name] ate pasta. She met [Name] at the restaurant."];
  B -- stanza --> F["[Name] ate pasta. She met [Name] at the restaurant."];
  C --> G{{Union or Intersection}}
  D --> G
  E --> G
  F --> G
  G -- Union --> H["[Name] ate pasta. She met [Name] at the restaurant."]
  G -- Intersection --> I["[Name] Lee ate pasta. She met Anna at the restaurant"]
```

## Model Idea 

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[sentence = 'Mary Lee ate pasta. She met Anna at the restaurant'];
  A -- Obtain start character index and end character index of names identified --> B["[ [0,8], [28,32] ]  (For cases where package correctly identifies full name) <br/><br/> or <br/><br/> [ [0,4] , [5,8], [28,32] ] (For cases where package mistakes first name and last name as two separate names)"];
  B -- Combine consecutive words where possible --> C["[[0,8],[28,32]]"];
  C -- Obtain name from original sentence --> D["sentence[0:8] <br/> sentence[28:32]"];
  D -- Name identified --> E[Mary Lee \n Anna];
  E -- Final Output --> H["[Name] ate pasta. She met [Name] at the restaurant"] 
```

### Use of character index

While it is possible to use the entity text identified as PERSON by the packages directly, character index was used in this implementation to provide users with an union/intersection option. Using character index ensures that the union/intersection function is applied on the same word.

Suppose we have this sentence: "Kim went to her office today. She had a meeting with Mr Kim." 
(This is solely for illustration purposes. The actual output is different.)

Package A tags "Kim" as PERSON. However, there is a possibility that A recognises the first "Kim" as a PERSON and not the second occurence. Let us assume that that is the case.

Suppose we have another package B that tags both "Kim" as PERSON. Without the use of character index to determine, the intersection of both packages would have given the following output:

'[Name] went to her office today. She had a meeting with Mr [Name].'. While this is a correct output, it does not fit the definition of intersection. 

By using character index, we can recognise that A recognises character index 0 to 3 as a person name, and not character index 56 to 59. The intersection betweeen [0,1,2,3] and [0,1,2,3,35,57,58,59] would have given [0,1,2,3]. Masking the word at sentence[0:3] would have given us:

'[Name] went to her office today. She had a meeting with Mr Kim.' , which fits our definition of intersection.

Word index was not used as different packages may tokenise the sentence differently, resulting in the same word having a different index.

### Masking of other details

Regular expression is used to mask other personal details. The case is ignored (specified in a separate argument). In this tool, the following details can be masked:

<details><summary>NRIC</summary>
<p>
  
Regular expression : r"([sftg]\d{7}[a-z])"
  
Replaced with : "[NRIC]"
  
The regular expression matches to any text that starts with S/F/T/G , followed by 7 numeric digits, and ends with any alphabet. Since IGNORECASE is specified, the alphabets can be of uppercase or lowercase.
  
```
Example: S1234567A 
```
  
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Case Number</summary>
<p>

Regular expression : r"(\d{10}[A-z])"
  
Replaced with : "[CASENO]"
  
The regular expression matches to any text starts with 10 consecutive digits followed by either an alphabet or the following symbols: ``` [ \ ] ^ _ ` ```
  
Since IGNORECASE is specified, the alphabets can be of uppercase or lowercase.
  
```  
Example :  1234567890A 
  
           0123456789_ 
```  
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Phone Number</summary>
<p>

Regular expression : r"(\d{8})"
  
Replaced with : "[PHONE]"
  
The regular expression matches any 8 consecutive digits. 

```  
Example: 91008100 
```
  
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>ID</summary>
<p>
  
Regular expression : r"([a-z]\d{4}[a-z])"
  
2nd Regular expression: r"(\d{5}[a-z])"
  
Replace with : "[ID]"
 
The first regular expression matches to any text that starts with an alphabet, followed by 4 consecutive digits and an alphabet. The second regular expression matches any text that starts with 5 consecutive digits, followed by any alphabet. Since IGNORECASE is specified, the alphabets can be of uppercase or lowercase.
 
```  
Example: A1234z
  
         12345A  
``` 
  
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Date</summary>
<p> 
  
Regular expression : r"(\d{1,2}.\d{1,2}.\d{2,4})"
  
2nd Regular expression: r"(\d{1,2}.(?:Jan(?:uary)?|Feb(?:ruary)?|Mar(?:ch)?|Apr(?:il)?|May|Jun(?:e)?|Jul(?:y)?|Aug(?:ust)?|Sep(?:tember)?|Oct(?:ober)?|Nov(?:ember)?|Dec(?:ember)?).\d{2,4})"
  
Replace with: "[DATE]"
  
The first regular expression matches any text that starts with either 1 or 2 consecutive digits, followed by any character except newline, followed by either 1 or 2 consecutive digits, followed by any character except newline, followed by either 2 or 4 consecutive digits. The second regular expression matches any text that starts with either 1 or 2 consecutive digits, followed by any character except newline, followed by a month which can be of an abbreviated form (eg Jan) or the full form (January), followed by any character except newline, followed by either 2 or 4 consecutive digits. Since IGNORECASE is specified, the alphabets can be of uppercase or lowercase.
  
Examples:
- 1/1/22
- 21-12-2022
- 05/04/2012
- 1 January 2012
- 05 aug 22
  
</p>
</details>
  
<details><summary>Admission Time</summary>
<p>

Regular expression : r"(admission Time.\s\d+.\d+)"

Replace with : "Admission Time: [Time]"
  
The regular expression matches any text that starts with the phrase "admission Time", followed by any character except newline, followed by any white space character, followed by one of more digit, followed by any character except newline, followed by one or more digit. Since IGNORECASE is specified, the alphabets can be of uppercase or lowercase.
  
```
Example: admission time: 2:45 
         Admission time: 12.30
```
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Ward Number</summary>
<p>

Regular expression : r"(ward.\w+\s[a-zA-z0-9]+)"
  
Replace with : "Ward:[WardNo]"
  
The regular expression matches any text that starts with the phrase "ward", followed by any character except newline, followed by at least one occurence of a word character i.e letters, alphanumeric, digits and underscore, followed by any whitespace characters, followed by at least one occurance of alphabets/digits/the following symbols: ``` [ \ ] ^ _ ` ```
  
Since IGNORECASE is specified, the alphabets can be of uppercase or lowercase.
 
```
Example: ward:type b1
         ward type A
```
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Bed Number</summary>
<p>

Regular expression : r"(bed.\s[a-z0-9]+)"

Replace with : "Bed:[BedNo]"

The regular expression matches any text that starts with the phrase "bed", followed by any character except newline, followed by any whitespace chracter, followed by at least one occurence of alphabet/digit. Since IGNORECASE is specified, the alphabets can be of uppercase or lowercase.
 
``` 
Example: bed: a12
         BED: 10
```
</p>
</details>
  
<details><summary>Patient Class</summary>
<p>
 
Regular expression : r"(patient class.\s\w+\s[A-Z])"
  
Replace with : "Patient Class:[Class]"
  
The regular expression matches any text that start with the phrase "patient class", followed by any character except newline, followed by any whitespace character, followed by at least one occurence of a word character i.e letters, alphanumeric, digits and underscore, followed by any whitespace character, followed by any alphabet. Since IGNORECASE is specified, the alphabets can be of uppercase or lowercase.
  
```
Example: patient class: Private A
```
</p>
</details>

To mask other informations, users have to provide a regular expression and a string to replace the matched text with. For more information, view [Instructions on Anonymization Tool](#Instructions-on-Anonymization-Tool)


## Evaluation Criteria

### Recall and Precision 

$$ Recall = {True\ Positive \over True Positive + False\ Negative } 
          = {Number\ of\ correct\ [Name]\ tag\ by\ package \over Number\ of\ [Name]\ tag\ in\ original\ sentence}  $$

$$ Precision = {True\ Positive \over True\ Positive + False\ Positive }
             = {Number\ of\ correct\ [Name]\ tag\ by\ package \over Number\ of\ [Name]\ tag\ by\ package}  $$

Recall and Precision were calculated for all packages on a sentence level and an overall level. 

For sentence level: Recall and Precision are calculated for each sentence using the formulas above. An average is obtained.

For overall level: 

$$ Overall\ Recall = {Total\ number\ of\ correct\ [Name]\ tag\ by\ package\ over\ 1000\ sentences \over Total\ number\ of\ [Name]\ tag\ in\ original\ 1000\ sentence}  $$

$$ Overall\ Precision = {Total\ number\ of\ correct\ [Name]\ tag\ by\ package\ over\ 1000\ sentences \over Total\ number\ of\ [Name]\ tag\ by\ package\ over\ 1000\ sentences}  $$

### Speed

The time package is used to compute the time taken for the anonymization process to be complete. The process is defined as shown in the diagram below:
             
```mermaid
graph TD;
    B{{Import relevant and load packages}}-->C{{Complete anonymization process}}; 
    C-->D{{Save the anonymized text/csv file to corresponding destination}};
```
A second comparison is done between the time taken for the anonymization process to be complete, given that the packages have already been imported. The respective results can be found under the [Performance](#Performance) section

### Memory Blocks 

The tracemalloc package is used to compare the allocated memory of the program. The peak size of the memory block traced by the module during the anonymization process will be compared.

## Performance

|     Precision (Overall Level)     |     0.815    |     0.869    |     0.944    |     0.895     |     0.804    |     0.888           |

|     Recall (Overall Level)        |     0.704    |     0.639    |     0.867    |     0.838     |     0.870    |     0.543           |

(Results may vary if different models or pipelines were used)

Possible case where union does not do better than an individual package:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[sentence = 'The game is an adaptation of Peter Jackson 's 2001 film <br/> The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring <br/> and his 2002 film The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers , <br/> which was released shortly after the game .'];
  A -- flair--> B["The game is an adaptation of [Name] 's 2001 film <br/> The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring <br/> and his 2002 film The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers ,  <br/> which was released shortly after the game ."];
  A -- stanza --> C["The game is an adaptation of [Name] 2001 film <br/> The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring <br/> and his 2002 film The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers , <br/> which was released shortly after the game ."];
  B --> D{{Union}};
  C --> D;
  D -- Final Output --> E["The game is an adaptation of [Name] 2001 film <br/> The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring <br/> and his 2002 film The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers , <br/> which was released shortly after the game ."] 
```
It can be observed that flair provides us with the correct output since  ``` 's ``` should not be considered as part of a person's name. However if we were to take an union of the stanza package and the flair package, ``` Peter Jackson 's ``` is masked due to stanza's tagging, giving us an incorrect input.

|     spaCy               |     17                |      102                      |
|     flair               |     724               |     1068                      |
|     stanza              |     605               |      253                      |
|     union               |     1425              |     1080                      |
|    intersection         |     1414              |     1080                      |

(Values include resources involved in importing the packages)

It can be observed that spaCy and NLTK are the faster packages, but at the expense of recall and precision. Although flair and stanza gave a higher recall and precision, they took a much longer time, at least 30 times longer than that of spaCy, and at least 10 times longer than that of NLTK. 

It is also expected that the union and intersection will take a much longer time since they involve all packages. However, the intersection option did not do very well, which is not surprising since it is more restrictive.

It appears that time taken is not significantly affected by the importing of packages but the peak memory block is. This suggests that the packages and models contribute significantly to the peak memory block. 

The current code file involves importing all the packages before defining the functions. If you do not wish to import all the packages, you may comment out the relevant lines.  

Note: 

1) Exact values may vary. Current results are obtained on a MacBook Air M1 Processor and rounded up)

2) A while loop is used under NLTK to obtain the start and end character index of the names identified. For spaCy, flair and stanza, these information could be obtained directly from the entities that the package has labelled.  

## Instructions on Anonymization Tool

Download and run anonymization_tool.py

If you would like to anonymize a single manual input, use the anonymized_text function

Sample:

```
anonymized_text('George met Anna today, 29/8/2022 at the airport.',package=['flair'],additional_details=[5])
```

If you would like to anonymize a txt file or csv file, use anonymized_file_input function

Sample:

```
anonymized_file_input('sample_discharge_summary.txt',package=['stanza','flair'],union_intersection='union',additional_details=[1,2,5],additional_expression=None)
```

It was noted that the packages may not identify lowercase names as well as names with its first character capitalised. It is encouraged to not do any data pre-processing (converting entire text to lowercase) before using the anonymization tool.

### Parameters

- user_input: str , required 
  - Item that user would like to anonymize

### Sample Cases 

#### Manual Input 

The user_input must be given a value for the function to run. The following are some examples. 

<details><summary>Normal Sentence </summary>
<p>
  
For a regular sentence with no inner quotes, both single and double quotation marks can be used. 
  
Using single quotation:

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Sentences with Quotes </summary>
<p>
  
Using single quotation marks for the quote within the input and double quotation marks for the overall input works for all packages:
 
![Screenshot 2022-08-30 at 11 55 52 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66881214/187484127-900aef70-3fc2-44f5-8070-1713890b7a5d.png)

Using double quotation marks for the quote within the input and single quotation marks for the overall input works for all packages as well:

If you would like to use double quotation marks for both the quote within the input and the overall input, a backslash must be used as shown:
  
![Screenshot 2022-08-30 at 11 59 36 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66881214/187484921-47f3011a-1202-41e2-ba4e-7da6e43be7f1.png)
  
This also applies to single quotation marks:

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Sentences with 's </summary>
<p>
 
A backslash must be used before ```'s``` for those who wishes to use single quotation marks in their input. This is optional for those who uses double quotation marks in their input
  
Using single quotation marks for input:

Using double quotation marks for input:
  
![Screenshot 2022-08-31 at 12 10 59 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66881214/187487280-59b5518f-3786-4994-8f8d-6e8501be7b97.png)
  
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Sentences with No Alphabets </summary>
<p>
 
![Screenshot 2022-08-31 at 12 18 25 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66881214/187488593-35a39f9d-3a01-4c1c-bf76-894e3fef9876.png)
  
As seen in the screenshot above, the tool is able to take in forwardslash as an input. Backslash poses a problem since it is read as an escape character. Using another backslash allows it to become an acceptable input but it will result in two backslashes as shown:

For txt file, use anonymized_file_input_color function

Sample:

```
anonymized_file_input_color('sample_discharge_summary.txt',package=['flair','stanza'],union_intersection='union',additional_details=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],additional_expression=[[r"(\d+.year.old)","[AGE]-year-old"]])
```

There will be two outputs, separated by a newline. Part 1 of the output will be the original text, with identified relevant details having a colored font and part 2 of the output will be the anonymized text, with relevant tags having the same colored font as its original text.

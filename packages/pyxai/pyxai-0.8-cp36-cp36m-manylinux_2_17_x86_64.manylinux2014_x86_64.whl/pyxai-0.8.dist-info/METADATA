<h1 align="center"> PyXAI v1 BETA (September 27, 2022) </h1>

PyXAI is a library in Python 3 (version 3.6 or later) allowing to bring explanations of various forms through reasons (sufficient, majoritary, contrastive, ...) from classifiers resulting of machine learning techniques (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Boosted Tree).

# Installation

## Installation from PyPi

The Python Package Index (PyPi) is the easiest way of installing PyXAI.

Note that you need first Python 3 (version 3.6, or later) to be installed.
You can do it, for example, from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Installing PyXAI (Linux)

Check if 'python3-pip' is installed. If it is not the case, execute:
```console
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

Or check if you have the last installed version:
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then, install PyXAI with the command 'pip3':

```console
python3 -m pip install pyxai
```

### Installing PyXAI (Mac OS)

PyXAI is currently compatible with Mac OS but without PyPi, see the installation (alternative) by Cloning from GitHub section for more details. 

### Installing PyXAI (Windows)

PyXAI is currently not compatible with windows (works in progress). 

### Updating the Version of PyXAI (for PyPi)

For updating your version of PyXAI, simply execute:

For linux/Mac:

```console
python3 -m pip install -U pyxai
```

## Installation (alternative) by Cloning from GitHub

An alternative to PyPi is to clone the code from GitHub.

Here is an illustration for linux. We assume that Python 3 is installed, and consequently 'pip3' is also installed.
In a console, type:
```console
git clone https://gitlab.univ-artois.fr/expekctation/software/PyLearningExplanation.git
```

You may need to update the environment variable 'PYTHONPATH', by typing for example:
```console
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:${PWD}/.."
```

Get the last version of pip:
```console
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

There are a few packages that PyXAI depends on that must be installed:
```console
python3 -m pip install numpy
python3 -m pip install wheel
python3 -m pip install pandas
python3 -m pip install termcolor
python3 -m pip install shap
python3 -m pip install wordfreq
python3 -m pip install python-sat[pblib,aiger]
python3 -m pip install xgboost
python3 -m pip install lxml
python3 -m pip install pycsp3
python3 -m pip install matplotlib
```

To compile the c++ code (python C extensions):
```console
python3 setup.py install --user
```
Of course, for this step, you need a C++ compiler.

Unfortunately, the compiled C extensions are not take into account in a virtual environment, therefore you must type
(we consider here that the virtual environment is in the 'env' directory and you are in the 'PyXAI' directory):
```console
cp build/lib.linux-x86_64-3.6/c_explainer.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/.
```
This last command depend of your python version (here: 3.6). 

Finally, you can test an example:
```console
python3 examples/DT/BuilderOrchids.py 
```

## Virtual Environment

Create and activate a new virtual environment:
```console
sudo apt-get install python3.6-venv
python3.6 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Update pip:
```console
python3.6 -m pip install -U pip
```

With this new version of pip, it is possible that you have to clear the pip cache:
```console
python3 -m pip cache purge
```

Now you can do the "Installation from PyPi" or the "Installation (alternative) by Cloning from GitHub".

Note that if you want install dependencies without internet connection, you can build a requirement.txt file:
```console
python3.6 -m pip freeze > requirements.txt 
python3.6 -m pip download -r requirements.txt -d requirements-download/
pip install -r requirements.txt --find-links=requirements-download --no-index
```

For deactivating the environment:
```console
deactivate
```

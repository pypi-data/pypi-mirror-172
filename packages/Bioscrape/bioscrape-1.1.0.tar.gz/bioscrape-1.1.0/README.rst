bioscrape - Biological Stochastic Simulation of Single Cell Reactions and Parameter Estimation
==============================================================================================

|Build Status|

Bioscrape is a Chemical Reaction Network Simulator written in cython for speed and python compatability. It can be used for deterministic, stochastic, or single cell simulation and also has parameter inference capabilities.

To install Bioscrape, in your terminal run the command:
   
   pip install bioscrape

Please note that Bioscrape is a cython extension module and requires a C++ compiler to be set up on your computer for installation. For more information, please visit https://github.com/biocircuits/bioscrape/wiki.

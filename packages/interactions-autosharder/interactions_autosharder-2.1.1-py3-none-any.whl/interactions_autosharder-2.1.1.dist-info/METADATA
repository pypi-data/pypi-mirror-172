You wanted to use `interactions.py` but were afraid of the lack of sharding? Or you did manual sharding but it sucks?
Well, this will help you out! Install via `pip install interactions-autosharder` and do this in your main file:

```python
from interactions.ext.autosharder import shard
from interactions import Client

bot = Client(...)

... # all your code here

shard(bot)

bot.start()


```
It will automatically get the needed shard count and create the shards. Optionally, insert the `shard_count` parameter
and set it to the amount of shards you want!

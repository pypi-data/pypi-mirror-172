'''PEPT-oriented visulisation tools.

Visualisation functions and classes for PEPT data, transparently working with
both `pept` base classes and raw NumPy arrays (e.g. `PlotlyGrapher.add_lines`
handles both `pept.LineData` and (N, 7) NumPy arrays).

The `PlotlyGrapher` class creates interactive, publication-ready 3D figures
with optional subplots which can also be exported to portable HTML files. The
`PlotlyGrapher2D` class is its two-dimensional counterpart, handling e.g.
`pept.Pixels`.

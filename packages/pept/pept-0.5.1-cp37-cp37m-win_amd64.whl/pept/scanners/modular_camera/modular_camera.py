    '''Initialise PEPT LoRs from the modular camera DAQ.

    Can read data from a `.da_1` file or equivalent. The file must contain
    the standard datawords from the modular camera output. This will then
    be automatically transformed into the standard `LineData` format
    with every row being `[time, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2]`, where the geometry
    is derived from the C-extension. The current useable geometry is a square
    layout with 4 stacks for 4 modules, separated by 250 mm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_file : str
        A string with the (absolute or relative) path to the data file
        from which the PEPT data will be read. It should include the
        full file name, along with the extension (.da_1)

    sample_size : int, optional
        An `int`` that defines the number of lines that should be
        returned when iterating over `_lines`. A `sample_size` of 0
        yields all the data as one single sample. (Default is 200)

    overlap : int, optional
        An `int` that defines the overlap between two consecutive
        samples that are returned when iterating over `_lines`.
        An overlap of 0 means consecutive samples, while an overlap
        of (`sample_size` - 1) means incrementing the samples by one.
        A negative overlap means skipping values between samples. An
        error is raised if `overlap` is larger than or equal to
        `sample_size`. (Default is 0)

    verbose : bool, optional
        An option that enables printing the time taken for the
        initialisation of an instance of the class. Useful when
        reading large files (10gb files for PEPT data is not unheard
        of). (Default is True)

    Returns
    -------
    LineData
        The initialised LoRs.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `overlap` >= `sample_size`. Overlap has to be smaller than
        `sample_size`. Note that it can also be negative.

    ValueError
        If the data file does not have (N, 7) shape.

class BirminghamMethod(pept.base.LineDataFilter):
    '''The Birmingham Method is an efficient, analytical technique for tracking
    tracers using the LoRs from PEPT data.

    Two main methods are provided: `fit_sample` for tracking a single numpy
    array of LoRs (i.e. a single sample) and `fit` which tracks all the samples
    encapsulated in a `pept.LineData` class *in parallel*.

    For the given `sample` of LoRs (a numpy.ndarray), this function minimises
    the distance between all of the LoRs, rejecting a fraction of lines that
    lie furthest away from the calculated distance. The process is repeated
    iteratively until a specified fraction (`fopt`) of the original subset of
    LORs remains.

    This class is a wrapper around the `birmingham_method` subroutine
    (implemented in C), providing tools for asynchronously tracking samples of
    LoRs. It can return `PointData` classes which can be easily manipulated and
    visualised.

    Attributes
    ----------
    fopt : float
        Floating-point number between 0 and 1, representing the target fraction
        of LoRs in a sample used to locate a tracer.

    get_used : bool, default False
        If True, attach an attribute ``._lines`` to the output PointData
        containing the sample of LoRs used (+ a column `used`).

    See Also
    --------
    pept.LineData : Encapsulate LoRs for ease of iteration and plotting.
    pept.PointData : Encapsulate points for ease of iteration and plotting.
    pept.utilities.read_csv : Fast CSV file reading into numpy arrays.
    PlotlyGrapher : Easy, publication-ready plotting of PEPT-oriented data.
    pept.scanners.ParallelScreens : Initialise a `pept.LineData` instance from
                                    parallel screens PEPT detectors.

    Examples
    --------
    A typical workflow would involve reading LoRs from a file, instantiating a
    `BirminghamMethod` class, tracking the tracer locations from the LoRs, and
    plotting them.

    >>> import pept
    >>> from pept.tracking.birmingham_method import BirminghamMethod

    >>> lors = pept.LineData(...)   # set sample_size and overlap appropriately
    >>> bham = BirminghamMethod()
    >>> locations = bham.fit(lors)  # this is a `pept.PointData` instance

    >>> grapher = PlotlyGrapher()
    >>> grapher.add_points(locations)
    >>> grapher.show()

    def __init__(self, fopt = 0.5, get_used = False):
        '''`BirminghamMethod` class constructor.

        fopt : float, default 0.5
            Float number between 0 and 1, representing the fraction of
            remaining LORs in a sample used to locate the particle.

        verbose : bool, default False
            Print extra information when initialising this class.

        # Use @fopt.setter (below) to do the relevant type-checking when
        # setting fopt (self._fopt is the internal attribute, that we only
        # access through the getter and setter of the self.fopt property).

        '''Use the Birmingham method to track a tracer location from a numpy
        array (i.e. one sample) of LoRs.

        For the given `sample` of LoRs (a numpy.ndarray), this function
        minimises the distance between all of the LoRs, rejecting a fraction of
        lines that lie furthest away from the calculated distance. The process
        is repeated iteratively until a specified fraction (`fopt`) of the
        original subset of LORs remains.

        Parameters
        ----------
        sample : (N, M>=7) numpy.ndarray
            The sample of LORs that will be clustered. Each LoR is expressed as
            a timestamps and a line defined by two points; the data columns are
            then `[time, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, extra...]`.

        Returns
        -------
        locations : numpy.ndarray or pept.PointData
            The tracked locations found.

        used : numpy.ndarray, optional
            If `get_used` is true, then also return a boolean mask of the LoRs
            used to compute the tracer location - that is, a vector of the same
            length as `sample`, containing 1 for the rows that were used, and 0
            otherwise.
            [Used for multi-particle tracking, not implemented yet].

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If `sample` is not a numpy array of shape (N, M), where M >= 7.

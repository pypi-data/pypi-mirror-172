class FPI(pept.base.VoxelsFilter):
    '''FPI is a modern voxel-based tracer-location algorithm that can reliably
    work with unknown numbers of tracers in fast and noisy environments.

    It was successfully used to track fast-moving radioactive tracers in pipe
    flows at the Virginia Commonwealth University. If you use this algorithm in
    your work, please cite the following paper:

        for positron emission particle tracking with multiple tracers. Nuclear

    Permission was granted by Dr. Cody Wiggins in March 2021 to publish his
    code in the `pept` library under the GNU v3.0 license.

    Two main methods are provided: `fit_sample` for tracking a single voxel
    space (i.e. a single `pept.Voxels`) and `fit` which tracks all the samples
    encapsulated in a `pept.VoxelData` class *in parallel*.

    Attributes
    ----------
    w : double
        Search range to be used in local maxima calculation. Typical values for
        w are 2 - 5 (lower number for more particles or smaller particle
        separation).

    r : double
        Fraction of peak value used as threshold. Typical values for r are
        usually between 0.3 and 0.6 (lower for more particles, higher for
        greater background noise)

    lld_counts : double, default 0
        A secondary lld to prevent assigning local maxima to voxels with very
        low values. The parameter lld_counts is not used much in practice -
        for most cases, it can be set to zero.

    See Also
    --------

    pept.PointData : Encapsulate points for ease of iteration and plotting.
    pept.utilities.read_csv : Fast CSV file reading into numpy arrays.
    PlotlyGrapher : Easy, publication-ready plotting of PEPT-oriented data.

    Examples
    --------
    A typical workflow would involve reading LoRs from a file, creating a lazy
    `VoxelData` voxellised representation, instantiating an `FPI` class,
    tracking the tracer locations from the LoRs, and plotting them.

    >>> import pept
    >>>
    >>> lors = pept.LineData(...)   # set sample_size and overlap appropriately
    >>> voxels = pept.tracking.Voxelize((50, 50, 50)).fit(lors)
    >>>
    >>> fpi = pept.tracking.FPI(w = 3, r = 0.4)
    >>> positions = fpi.fit(voxels) # this is a `pept.PointData` instance

    A much more efficient approach would be to create a `pept.Pipeline`
    containing a voxelization step and then FPI:

    >>> from pept.tracking import *
    >>>
    >>> pipeline = Voxelize((50, 50, 50)) + FPI() + Stack()
    >>> positions = pipeline.fit(lors)

    Finally, plotting results:

    >>> from pept.plots import PlotlyGrapher
    >>>
    >>> grapher = PlotlyGrapher()
    >>> grapher.add_points(positions)
    >>> grapher.show()

    >>> from pept.plots import PlotlyGrapher2D
    >>> PlotlyGrapher2D().add_timeseries(positions).show()

        '''Use the FPI algorithm to locate a tracer from a single voxellised

        A sample of LoRs can be voxellised using the `pept.Voxels.from_lines`
        method before calling this function.

        Parameters
        ----------
        voxels : pept.Voxels
            A single voxellised space (i.e. from a single sample of LoRs) for
            which the tracers' locations will be found using the FPI method.

        Returns
        -------
        locations : numpy.ndarray or pept.PointData
            The tracked locations found; if `as_array` is True, they are
            returned as a NumPy array with columns [time, x, y, z, error_x,

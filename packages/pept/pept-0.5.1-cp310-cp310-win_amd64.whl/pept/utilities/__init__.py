'''PEPT-oriented utility functions.

The utility functions include low-level optimised Cython functions (e.g.
`find_cutpoints`) that are of common interest across the `pept` package, as
well as I/O functions, parallel maps and pixel/voxel traversal algorithms.

Even though the functions are grouped in directories (subpackages) and files
(modules), unlike the rest of the package, they are all imported into the
`pept.utilities` root, so that their import paths are not too long.

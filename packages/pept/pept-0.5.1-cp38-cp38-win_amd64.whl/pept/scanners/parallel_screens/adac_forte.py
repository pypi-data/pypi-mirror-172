):
    '''Initialise PEPT lines of response (LoRs) from a binary file outputted by
    the ADAC Forte parallel screen detector list mode (common file extension
    ".da01").

    Parameters
    ----------
    filepath : str
        The path to a ADAC Forte-generated binary file from which the LoRs
        will be read into the `LineData` format. If you have multiple files,
        use a wildcard (*) after their common substring to concatenate them,
        e.g. "DS1.da*" will add ["DS1.da01", "DS1.da02", "DS1.da02_02"].

    sample_size : int, default 0
        An `int` that defines the number of lines that should be returned
        when iterating over `lines`. A `sample_size` of 0 yields all the
        data as one single sample. A good starting value would be 200 times
        the maximum number of tracers that would be tracked.

    overlap : int, default 0
        An `int` that defines the overlap between two consecutive samples
        that are returned when iterating over `lines`. An overlap of 0
        implies consecutive samples, while an overlap of
        (`sample_size` - 1) means incrementing the samples by one. A
        negative overlap means skipping values between samples. An error is
        raised if `overlap` is larger than or equal to `sample_size`.

    verbose : bool, default True
        An option that enables printing the time taken for the
        initialisation of an instance of the class. Useful when reading
        large files (10gb files for PEPT data is not unheard of).

    Returns
    -------
    LineData
        The initialised LoRs.

    Raises
    ------
    FileNotFoundError
        If the input `filepath` does not exist.

    ValueError
        If `overlap` >= `sample_size`. Overlap has to be smaller than
        `sample_size`. Note that it can also be negative.

    pept.LineData : Encapsulate LoRs for ease of iteration and plotting.
    pept.PointData : Encapsulate points for ease of iteration and plotting.
    pept.read_csv : Fast CSV file reading into numpy arrays.
    PlotlyGrapher : Easy, publication-ready plotting of PEPT-oriented data.

    Examples
    --------
    Initialise a `ParallelScreens` array for three LoRs on a parallel screens
    PEPT scanner (i.e. each line is defined by **two** points each) with a
    head separation of 500 mm:

    >>> lors = pept.scanners.adac_forte("binary_data_adac.da01")
    Initialised the PEPT data in 0.011 s.

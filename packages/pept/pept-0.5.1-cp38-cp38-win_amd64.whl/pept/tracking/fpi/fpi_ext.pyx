    FPI is a modern tracer-location algorithm that was successfully used to
    track fast-moving radioactive tracers in pipe flows at the Virginia
    Commonwealth University. If you use this algorithm in your work, please

    The points returned by this function are in *voxel dimensions*, without
    timestamps. They can be translated into physical dimensions and timestamps
    can be added after calling it, e.g. with the `pept.tracking.fpi.FPI`
    class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    voxels: (L, W, D) numpy.ndarray[ndim = 2, dtype = numpy.float64]
        The 3D grid of voxels, initialised to zero. It can be created with
        `numpy.zeros((length, width, depth))`.

    w: double
        Search range to be used in local maxima calculation. Typical values for
        w are 2 - 5 (lower number for more particles or smaller particle
        separation).

    r: double
        Fraction of peak value used as threshold. Typical values for r are
        usually between 0.3 and 0.6 (lower for more particles, higher for
        greater background noise)

    lldCounts: double, default 0
        A secondary lld to prevent assigning local maxima to voxels with very
        low values. The parameter lldCounts is not used much in practice -
        for most cases, it can be set to zero.

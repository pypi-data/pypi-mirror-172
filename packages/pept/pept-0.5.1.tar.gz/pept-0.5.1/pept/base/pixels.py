    The input parameters *must* be numpy arrays, otherwise an error will

    `lines`.

    The `number_of_pixels` in each dimension must be defined. If the
    pixel space boundaries `xlim` or `ylim` are not defined, they
    are inferred as the boundaries of the `lines`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lines : (M, N>=5) numpy.ndarray
        The lines that will be pixellised, each defined by a timestamp and
        two 2D points, so that the data columns are [time, x1, y1, x2, y2].
        Note that extra columns are ignored.

    number_of_pixels : (2,) list[int]
        The number of pixels in the x- and y-dimensions, respectively.

    xlim : (2,) list[float], optional
        The lower and upper boundaries of the pixellised volume in the
        x-dimension, formatted as [x_min, x_max]. If undefined, it is
        inferred from the boundaries of `lines`.

    ylim : (2,) list[float], optional
        The lower and upper boundaries of the pixellised volume in the
        y-dimension, formatted as [y_min, y_max]. If undefined, it is
        inferred from the boundaries of `lines`.

    Returns
    -------
    pept.Pixels
        A new `Pixels` object with the pixels through which the lines were
        traversed.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the input `lines` does not have the shape (M, N>=5). If the
        `number_of_pixels` is not a 1D list with exactly 2 elements, or
        any dimension has fewer than 2 pixels.

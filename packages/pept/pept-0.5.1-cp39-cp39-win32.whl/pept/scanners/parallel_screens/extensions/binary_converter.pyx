    ::

        Function signature:
            binary_converter(filepath)

    Binary converter for the ADAC Forte dual-head gamma camera native list
    mode data. Given the `filepath` to such a binary file (usually with
    extension ".da01"), this function converts the binary contents to the
    general line of response format `[time, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2]`, where
    `z1 = 0` and `z2 = screen_separation` (found from the file).

    The LoRs are returned as a (N, 7) NumPy array, where N is the number of
    LoRs that were found in the file.

    Function parameters
    -------------------
    filepath: str-like
        A string of characters containing the path to the binary file. The
        string's contents are not read in - it will only be used with the
        `fopen` function, so it can contain any characters allowed by the OS
        file system.

    Returns
    -------
    lors: (N, 7) NumPy array
        The 2D array of LoRs, each row containing the time and coordinates of
        the first and second point defining a 3D line, respectively:
        `[time, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2]`.

    Raises
    ------
    FileNotFoundError
        If the `filepath` does not exist or points to an invalid ADAC binary
        file, in which case the C converter subroutine (binary_converter_ext.c)
        prints a specific message.

    --------

    >>> from pept.scanners.parallel_screens import binary_converter
    >>>
    >>> lines = binary_converter("adac_experiment_data.da01")

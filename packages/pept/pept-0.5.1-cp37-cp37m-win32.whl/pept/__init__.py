PEPT
====

A Python library that unifies Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT)
research, including tracking, simulation, data analysis and visualisation
tools.

Extended Summary
----------------
This Python library integrates all the tools necessary to perform research
using Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT). The library includes
algorithms for the location, identification and tracking of particles, in
addition to tools for visualisation and analysis, and utilities allowing the
realistic simulation of PEPT data.

PEPT is a technique developed at the University of Birmingham [1]_ which allows
the non-invasive, three-dimensional tracking of one or more 'tracer' particles
through particulate, fluid or multiphase systems. The technique allows particle
or fluid motion to be tracked with sub-millimetre accuracy and sub-millisecond
temporal resolution and, due to its use of highly-penetrating 511keV gamma
rays, can be used to probe the internal dynamics of even large, dense,
optically opaque systems - making it ideal for industrial as well as
scientific applications.

PEPT is performed by radioactively labelling a particle with a positron-
emitting radioisotope such as fluorine-18 (18F) or gallium-66 (66Ga), and using
the back-to-back gamma rays produced by electron-positron annihilation events
in and around the tracer to triangulate its spatial position. Each detected
gamma ray represents a line of response (LoR) .

Subpackages Provided
--------------------
The `pept` package provides four base classes at its root - `PointData`,
`LineData`, `Pixels`, and `Voxels` - acting as common data formats that the
rest of the package will use for its tracking, analysis and visualisation
algorithms. Thus any subroutine integrated in the `pept` package can be used
interchangeably with new PET / PEPT scanner geometries, data formats or novel
algorithms.

Performance
-----------
Significant effort has been put into making the algorithms in this package as
fast as possible. The most compute-intensive parts have been implemented in
`C` / `Cython` and parallelised, where possible, using `joblib` and
`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`. For example, using the `peptml`
subpackage [2]_, analysing 1,000,000 LoRs on the author's machine (mid 2012
MacBook Pro) takes ~26 seconds.

Examples
--------
You can download data samples from the UoB Positron Imaging Centre's
Repository (`link <https://bit.ly/pept-example-data-repo>`_). A
small but complete analysis script using the PEPT-ML algorithm is given below.

First import the `pept` package and read in lines of response (LoRs) from our
online repository. We'll use a sample of real data from an experiment conducted
at Birmingham - two tracers rotating at 42RPM.

.. code-block:: python

    import pept

    lors_raw = pept.utilities.read_csv(
        ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uob-positron-imaging-centres/"
         "example_data/master/sample_2p_42rpm.csv"),  # Concatenate long string
        skiprows = 16                                 # Skip file header
    )

Our data is in a format typical of the parallel screens PEPT detector from
Birmingham. Convert it to our package's scanner-agnostic line format; we'll
iterate through them one sample at a time, tracking the tracer locations:

.. code-block:: python

    lors = pept.scanners.ParallelScreens(
        lors_raw, screen_separation = 712, sample_size = 200
    )

Now it's time for some machine learning! Import the `peptml` package and
transform the LoRs into *cutpoints* that we'll use to find tracer locations.

.. code-block:: python

    from pept.tracking import peptml
    cutpoints = peptml.Cutpoints(lors, max_distance = 0.15)

Create a *clusterer* and use the cutpoints to find the centres of the tracers
as they move through our system:

.. code-block:: python

    clusterer = peptml.HDBSCANClusterer()
    centres = clusterer.fit(cutpoints)

This data looks alright (we'll plot everything in a minute), but we can do
better. We can iterate through the centres once more, clustering them again,
to get smooth, tight trajectories; for this, we'll set a small sample size and
large overlap:

.. code-block:: python

    centres.sample_size = 60
    centres.overlap = 59
    centres_2pass = clusterer.fit(centres)

One more step! The locations of the two tracers tracked above are intertwined;
we need to separate them into individual trajectories. We have a module for
just that:

.. code-block:: python

    import pept.tracking.trajectory_separation as tsp
    points_window = 10
    trajectory_cut_distance = 20
    trajectories = tsp.segregate_trajectories(
        centres_2pass, points_window, trajectory_cut_distance
    )

Finally, let's plot some LoRs, the tracer centres after one pass of clustering
and after the second pass of clustering, and the separated trajectories. Let's
use Plotly to produce some beautiful, interactive, 3D graphs:

.. code-block:: python

    from pept.plots import PlotlyGrapher
    subplot_titles = ["Lines of Response (LoRs)", "HDBSCAN Clustering",
                      "2-pass Clustering", "Separated Trajectories"]
    grapher = PlotlyGrapher(rows = 2, cols = 2, zlim = [0, 712],
                            subplot_titles = subplot_titles)

    grapher.add_lines(lors.lines[:400])             # Only the first 400 LoRs
    grapher.add_points(centres, col = 2)
    grapher.add_points(centres_2pass, row = 2)
    grapher.add_points(trajectories, row = 2, col = 2)

    grapher.show()

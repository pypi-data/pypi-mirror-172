Questions
~~~~~~~~~

If you have any question, you can:

* `open an issue <https://github.com/flozz/yoga-image-optimizer/issues>`_ on Github,
* or `ask on Discord <https://discord.gg/P77sWhuSs4>`_ (I am not always available for chatting but I try to answer to everyone).

Bugs
~~~~

If you found a bug, please `open an issue <https://github.com/flozz/yoga-image-optimizer/issues>`_ on Github with as much information as possible:

* What is your operating system / Linux distribution (and its version),
* How you installed the software,
* All the logs and message outputted by the software,
* ...

Pull Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please consider `filing a bug <https://github.com/flozz/yoga-image-optimizer/issues>`_ before starting to work on a new feature. This will allow us to discuss the best way to do it. This is of course not necessary if you just want to fix some typo or small errors in the code.

Please note that your code must pass tests and follow the coding style defined by the `pep8 <https://pep8.org/>`_. `Flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ and `Black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ are used on this project to enforce coding style.

Translating YOGA Image Optimizer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the software is not available in your language, you can help translate it.

To translate YOGA Image Optimizer, you can:

* submit your translations using a Pull Request on Github,
* or translate online using POEditor:

  * ‚Üí  https://poeditor.com/join/project/RoQ2r9rv89

submit your translations using a Pull Request on Github. Do not forget to add your name as the translation of the ``translator-credits`` key (one name per line, e-mail is optional)::

    #: yoga_image_optimizer/about_dialog.py:38
    msgid "translator-credits"
    msgstr ""
    "John DOE\n"
    "Other TRANSLATOR <foobar@example.org>\n"


Running The Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will first have to install `nox <https://nox.thea.codes/>`_::

    pip3 install nox

Then you can check for lint error::

    nox --session lint

or run the tests::

    nox --session test

To run the tests only for a specific Python version, you can use following commands (the corresponding Python interpreter must be installed on your machine)::

    nox --session test-3.7
    nox --session test-3.8
    nox --session test-3.9

You can also fix automatically coding style errors with::

    nox -s black_fix

Extract, Update or Build Translations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will first have to install `nox <https://nox.thea.codes/>`_::

    pip3 install nox

To extract messages and update locales run::

    nox --session locales_update

To compile locales, run::

    nox --session locales_compile

**NOTE:** you will need to have ``xgettext``, ``msgmerge`` and ``msgfmt`` executable installed on your system to run the above commands. On Debian¬†/ Ubuntu, they can be installed with the following command::

    sudo apt install gettext

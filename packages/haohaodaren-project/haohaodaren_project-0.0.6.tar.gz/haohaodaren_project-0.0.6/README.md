# OpenNE: An open source toolkit for Network Embedding

This repository provides a standard NE/NRL(Network Representation Learningï¼‰training and testing framework. In this framework, we unify the input and output interfaces of different NE models and provide scalable options for each model. Moreover, we implement typical NE models under this framework based on tensorflow, which enables these models to be trained with GPUs.

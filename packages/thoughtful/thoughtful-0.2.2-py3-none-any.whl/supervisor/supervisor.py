        The supervisor is the digital worker's workflow organizer. It is the
        floor supervisor of a factory's assembly line. It is responsible for
        the order of step flow, and using the Reporter to report the results
        of each step.

        Handles all the primary logic, flow, and reporting for the worker.

        Args:
            worker (DigitalWorker): The worker to supervise.
            reporter (Reporter, optional): Maintains the work report that
                is written during worker execution. Defaults to None.
            manifest (Manifest, optional): The manifest of the digital worker
                to supervise. Typically, this is constructed from a YAML file.
                Defaults to None.
            screenshot_path (pathlib.Path): Where screenshots are written to.
            output_path (pathlib.Path): Where the work report will be written
                to.
            print_step_reports (bool): If True, print each step report to
                stdout after each step is run. If False, silence these step
                reports in stdout.
            print_final_report (bool): If True, print the final work report
                to stdout after the worker is executed. If False, silence
                the work report in stdout.

        Attributes:
            worker (DigitalWorker): The worker to execute.
            manifest (Manifest): The digital worker's design document.
            reporter (Reporter): The work report maintainer.
            screenshot_path (pathlib.Path): Where screenshots are written to.
            output_path (pathlib.Path): Where the work report will be written
                to.

                stdout after each step is run. If False, silence these step
                reports in stdout.

                the work report in stdout.
            state_machine (StateMachine): Determines the order of steps to
                be executed.

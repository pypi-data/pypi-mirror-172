<big>Supervisor is a <u>Workflow Engine</u> for Digital Workers that constructs
and broadcasts a detailed and structured telemetric log, called the <u>Run Report</u>.

Supervisor is quick and easy to implement:</big>

```python
from supervisor import step, step_scope, supervise, set_step_status


# using the step decorator
@step("2")
def step_2(name: str) -> bool:
    print(f'Hello {name}')
    return True # some condition

def main() -> None:
    # using the step_scope context manager
    with step_scope('1') as step_context:
        try:
            print("Getting credentials")
            # ...
        except Exception as e:
            # set step status using method
            step_context.set_status("warning")

    if not step_2():
        # set step status using function
        set_step_status("2", "fail")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with supervise():
        main()
```

## Typing stubs for editdistance

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `editdistance` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `editdistance`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/editdistance. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `918f2266da5d0a3ed4cb5fd9b756f1e0ceae5097`.

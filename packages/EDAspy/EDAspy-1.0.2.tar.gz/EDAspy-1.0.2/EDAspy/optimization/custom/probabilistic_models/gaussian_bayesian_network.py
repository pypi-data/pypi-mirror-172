    This probabilistic model is  Gaussian Bayesian Network. All the relationships between the variables in
    the model are defined to be linearly Gaussian, and the variables distributions are assumed to be
    Gaussian. This is a very common approach when facing to continuous data as it is relatively easy and fast
    to learn a Gaussian distributions between variables. This implementation uses Pybnesian library [1].

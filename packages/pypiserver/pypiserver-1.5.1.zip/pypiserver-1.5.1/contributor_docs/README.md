# Hello

Welcome to the contributor's documentation section of `pypiserver`.  
Here you can find information about the inner working of the system.  
Contributions and support in maintaining (both the project and these documents)
is very welcome :v:  

> This documentation is still a work in progress and would benefit from
    your help!  
> Some areas to describe are highlighted in
    [this issue](https://github.com/pypiserver/pypiserver/issues/368),
    but feel free to add if you see something missing there.  
> All the help will be very appreciated! :)  

## Find more information

If something is missing in the documentation here, try checking in the
`README.rst` and if it's still not there, don't hesitate to contribute.  

## Documentation organization

This folder contains various documents describing the `pypiserver` that might
be of interest to someone studying it in more details.  
The documentation files are written in `.md` and it will be great if new
files are added in the same format.
